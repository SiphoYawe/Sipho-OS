### Step 2: Understand Your Audience

**Demographic Considerations:**

| Factor | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| **Age** | Younger → brighter, bolder; Older → muted, sophisticated |
| **Gender** | Avoid stereotypes; test with actual audience |
| **Income** | Premium → black, gold, deep colors; Budget → bright, friendly |
| **Culture** | Research cultural color meanings; avoid offense |

**Psychographic Alignment:**

- **Traditional** → Classic, timeless palettes
- **Eco-conscious** → Green, earth tones
- **Tech-savvy** → Blue, clean, modern palettes

### Step 3: Analyze Competition

**Competitive Analysis Matrix:**

| Question | Action |
|----------|--------|
| What colors dominate your industry? | Map competitor palettes |
| Is there a color everyone uses? | Consider differentiation |
| Is there a gap in color usage? | Opportunity to stand out |
| What would be unexpected yet appropriate? | Strategic differentiation |

**Differentiation Strategies:**
1. **Blend In** — Use industry norms to signal belonging
2. **Stand Out** — Use unexpected colors to differentiate
3. **Own a Color** — Claim a color strongly (like Tiffany blue)

### Step 4: Select Your Palette

**The 60-30-10 Framework:**
