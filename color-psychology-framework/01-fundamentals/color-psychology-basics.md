# Color Psychology Basics

## What Is Color Psychology?

Color psychology is the study of how colors affect human behavior, mood, and decision-making. Colors can evoke emotions, influence perceptions, and drive actions—often unconsciously.

## How Colors Affect Us

### Physiological Effects
- **Red** increases heart rate and respiration
- **Blue** lowers blood pressure and calms the nervous system

### Psychological Effects
- Colors trigger emotional associations (learned and innate)
- Context shapes color interpretation
- Personal experiences influence individual responses
- Cultural background affects color meaning

## The Color Wheel Fundamentals

### Primary Colors

- Form the foundation of all other colors

### Secondary Colors
- **Green** (Blue + Yellow)
- **Orange** (Red + Yellow)
- **Purple** (Red + Blue)

### Tertiary Colors
- Created by mixing primary and secondary colors
- Examples: Red-orange, Yellow-green, Blue-purple
