# The Stair Step Method of Entrepreneurship

## Core Concept

The Stair Step Method is a progressive approach to building SaaS businesses. Instead of jumping directly into complex standalone SaaS, you build skills, confidence, revenue, and time through smaller steps.

## The Three Steps

### Step 1: Your First Product

**Goal:** Simple product with simple marketing plan

**Characteristics:**
- Single traffic channel (usually platform-based)
- Low complexity product
- Learn the fundamentals

**Examples:**
- WordPress plugin
- Shopify add-on
- Chrome extension
- Simple mobile app

**Why Start Here:**
- Lower risk to learn basics
- Built-in distribution (app stores, plugin repositories)
- Faster feedback loops
- Generate first revenue

### Step 2: Rinse and Repeat

**Goal:** Double down on what works

**Characteristics:**
- Repeat successful model from Step 1
- Build multiple products
- Master free/low-cost traffic channels
- Own your time

**Strategy:**
```
Analyze Step 1 Success → Identify Patterns → Apply to New Products → Scale What Works
```

**Outcomes:**
- Portfolio of products generating revenue
- Deep expertise in specific marketing channels
- Financial runway for Step 3
- Confidence from multiple successes

### Step 3: Standalone SaaS

**Goal:** Build complex, high-growth SaaS product

**Characteristics:**
- Complex to build AND market
- Long on-ramp to substantial revenue
- Requires experience, skills, confidence, and revenue from earlier steps

**Why Wait for Step 3:**
- SaaS is extremely competitive
- Requires capital (financial or time)
- Marketing is complex (multiple channels needed)
- Technical debt compounds fast

## Benefits of the Stair Step Approach

### 1. Skill Building
Each step teaches essential skills:
- Step 1: Product creation, basic marketing, customer support
- Step 2: Multi-product management, channel mastery, systems thinking
- Step 3: Complex product development, team building, scaling

### 2. Risk Reduction
Progressive de-risking:
```
Step 1: Risk $1K-5K and time
Step 2: Risk $5K-20K and more time
Step 3: Risk $50K-200K+ but with skills to succeed
```

### 3. Financial Foundation
Each step funds the next:
- Step 1 products: $500-5,000/month
- Step 2 portfolio: $10,000-30,000/month
- Step 3 runway: Self-funded SaaS launch

### 4. Psychological Preparation
Build founder confidence through:
- Small wins that compound
- Failure in low-stakes environments
- Pattern recognition from multiple attempts
