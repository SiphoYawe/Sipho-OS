# Marketing Funnels

## Funnel Philosophy

Your marketing funnel is the journey from stranger to paying customer. The type of funnel you need depends on your price point and sales complexity.

| **Price point** | <$500/month typically |
| **Complexity** | Simple product, clear value |

Visitor → Signup → Trial → Self-Serve Onboarding → Paid Customer
```

### High-Touch Funnel

**For products requiring sales assistance.**

| -------------- | ----------- |
| **Price point** | >$500/month typically |
| **Complexity** | Complex product or buying process |

## SaaS Cheat Code: Dual Funnels

**The most powerful approach: Serve both funnels simultaneously.**

### How Dual Funnels Work

| Funnel | Target | Entry Point | Close |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- | ----- |
| **Low-touch** | Small businesses, individuals | Self-serve signup | Auto-conversion |
| **High-touch** | Enterprises, teams | Demo request | Sales team |

### Why Dual Funnels Win

1. **Capture entire market** - Both self-serve and enterprise
2. **Land and expand** - Start low-touch, upsell high-touch
3. **Revenue diversification** - Multiple customer types
4. **Lower CAC average** - Self-serve subsidizes sales cost

## Low-Touch Funnel Optimization

### The Trial Experience

| Element | Best Practice |
| ------- | ------------- |
| **Length** | 7-14 days (force action) |
| **Credit card** | Required (filters tire-kickers) |
| **Features** | Full access (show full value) |
| **Support** | Self-serve + chat |

### Onboarding Sequences

**Email sequence example:**
```
Day 0: Welcome, key first steps
Day 1: Quick win tutorial
Day 3: Feature highlight #1
Day 5: Feature highlight #2
Day 7: Social proof/case study
Day 10: Trial ending reminder
Day 13: Last chance + offer
```

### Minimum Path to Awesome (MPA)

**The fastest route to "aha moment" for your product.**

| Product Type | MPA Example |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Email marketing | First form installed on website |
| Analytics | Tracking code installed, first data |
| CRM | First contacts imported |
| Scheduling | First meeting booked via link |

**Onboarding goal:** Get every trial user to MPA ASAP.

### In-App Onboarding

| Technique | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| Progress checklist | Show path to value |
| Tooltips | Guide key features |
| Empty states | Encourage first action |
| Celebration moments | Reward progress |
| Contextual help | Answer questions in-flow |

## High-Touch Funnel Optimization

### Demo Request Optimization

| Element | Recommendation |
| ------- | -------------- |
| **Form length** | Short (name, email, company, use case) |
| **Response time** | <5 minutes ideal, <24 hours maximum |
| **Scheduling** | Embedded calendar on confirmation |
| **Pre-demo email** | Expectations, preparation |

### The Demo Structure

**Recommended demo flow (30-45 minutes):**

| Phase | Time | Purpose |
| ----- | ---- | ------- |
| **Discovery** | 10-15 min | Understand their needs |
| **Tailored demo** | 15-20 min | Show relevant features |
| **Q&A** | 5-10 min | Address objections |
| **Next steps** | 5 min | Clear call to action |

### Demo Best Practices

1. **Don't start with product** - Start with questions
2. **Customize to their needs** - Not a generic tour
3. **Show the value, not features** - What it does FOR them
4. **Have a clear CTA** - What happens next?
5. **Follow up immediately** - Strike while hot

### Post-Demo Sequence

```
Immediately: Recap email with key points discussed
Day 1: Check-in, answer questions
Day 3: Additional resources relevant to their needs
Day 7: Check decision timeline
Day 14: Gentle follow-up if no response
```

## Conversion Optimization

### Landing Page Essentials

| Element | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Clear headline** | What you do + who for |
| **Subheadline** | Key benefit statement |
| **Social proof** | Logos, testimonials, numbers |
| **Benefits list** | What they get |
| **Feature overview** | How it works |
| **CTA** | Clear action (trial/demo) |
| **FAQ** | Address objections |

### A/B Testing Priority

Test in this order (highest impact first):

1. **Headline** - Biggest impact on conversion
2. **CTA** - Text and placement
3. **Social proof** - Type and positioning
4. **Price presentation** - How pricing is shown
5. **Form fields** - What you ask for

### Conversion Rate Benchmarks

| Metric | Poor | Average | Good | Great |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ---- | ----- |
| Landing page to trial | <2% | 2-5% | 5-10% | >10% |
| Trial to paid (no CC) | <10% | 10-15% | 15-25% | >25% |
| Trial to paid (with CC) | <25% | 25-40% | 40-60% | >60% |
| Demo to close | <15% | 15-25% | 25-40% | >40% |

## LLM-ACTIONABLE-INSIGHTS

### Funnel Type Selection

When user asks about funnels:

```
1. Ask: "What's your average deal size?"
2. Ask: "How complex is your product to understand?"
3. Ask: "Do customers need demos to buy?"
4. Recommend funnel type based on answers
```

### Recommendation Matrix

```python
def recommend_funnel(acv, complexity, demo_needed):
    if acv < 300 and not demo_needed:
        return "Low-touch: Self-serve signup and onboarding"

    if acv > 1000 or complexity == "high":
        return "High-touch: Demo-driven sales process"

    if acv between 300-1000:
        return "Dual funnel: Offer both self-serve AND demo option"

    return "Start with low-touch, add high-touch as you scale"
```

### Conversion Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
| ------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Low visitor→trial | Weak value prop or targeting | Improve landing page messaging |
| Low trial→paid | Poor onboarding or product | Improve MPA, onboarding sequence |
| Low demo→close | Sales process or objections | Improve demo, address objections |
| High time-to-close | Friction in process | Streamline buying journey |

### Key Messages

- "Dual funnels capture entire market (SaaS Cheat Code)"
- "Credit card required = 2-3x higher trial conversion"
- "Find your Minimum Path to Awesome"
- "Demo is for discovery, not just showing features"
- "Measure every funnel stage, optimize biggest drop-off"
