# Marketing Approaches

## The "Big 5" Marketing Approaches

These five marketing approaches work for bootstrapped SaaS companies. Every marketing tactic you encounter will fit into one of these buckets.

## 1. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

**What it is:** Ranking in search engines for terms your customers search.

### Components

| Type | Description | Example |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **Content SEO** | Blog posts, guides, resources | "How to improve email deliverability" |
| **Product SEO** | Product pages ranking for solution terms | "Email marketing software" |
| **Technical SEO** | Site speed, structure, indexability | Core Web Vitals, site architecture |

### Evaluation

| Factor | Score |
| ------ | ----- |
| **Speed** | Slow (6-18 months to see results) |
| **Cost** | Low-Medium (content creation, tools) |
| **Scalability** | High (compounds over time) |

### When SEO Works

- Customers search for solutions
- Long-term investment horizon
- Can produce quality content
- Patient for delayed results

### When SEO Doesn't Work

- Need immediate results
- Very new/emerging market
- Highly competitive keywords
- No content creation capability

## 2. Content Marketing

**What it is:** Creating valuable content that attracts your ideal customers.

### Content Types

| Type | Purpose | Funnel Position |
| ---- | ------- | --------------- |
| **Blog posts** | Attract and educate | Top |
| **Guides/Ebooks** | Deep education, lead capture | Middle |
| **Case studies** | Social proof | Bottom |
| **Video content** | Engagement, education | All |
| **Podcasts** | Authority building | Top/Middle |
| **Newsletters** | Nurture, retention | All |

### Evaluation

| Factor | Score |
| ------ | ----- |
| **Speed** | Slow (builds over months) |
| **Cost** | Medium (time/writing costs) |
| **Scalability** | High (content accumulates) |

### Content Marketing Principles

1. **Create for your ideal customer** - Not for everyone
2. **Solve real problems** - Actionable, not fluff
3. **Consistency beats volume** - Better weekly than sporadic
4. **Promote what you create** - Creation is half the work
5. **Measure what matters** - Trials, not just traffic

---

## 3. Paid Advertising

**What it is:** Paying for visibility through ads on various platforms.

### Common Channels

| Channel | Best For | Typical Cost |
| ------- | -------- | ------------ |
| **Google Ads** | High intent searches | High CPC ($5-50+) |
| **Facebook/Instagram** | Awareness, retargeting | Medium ($1-10 CPC) |
| **LinkedIn** | B2B targeting | Very high ($10-50+ CPC) |
| **Twitter/X** | Tech audience | Medium |
| **Podcast ads** | Niche audiences | $15-50 CPM |

### Evaluation

| Factor | Score |
| ------ | ----- |
| **Speed** | Fast (immediate traffic) |
| **Cost** | High (ongoing expense) |
| **Scalability** | Medium (limited by CAC) |

### Paid Advertising Rules

1. **Know your CAC limit** - Never exceed payback period
2. **Start small** - Test before scaling
3. **Track everything** - Attribution is critical
4. **Iterate constantly** - Ads decay over time
5. **Have a conversion funnel** - Ads need landing pages

### When Paid Works

- Clear ROI math (know your LTV)
- Quick iteration capability
- Enough budget to test properly
- Landing pages converting well

| **Native integrations** | Built into other products | "Integrates with Slack" |
| **API partnerships** | Technical connections | Zapier, Make |
| **Referral partnerships** | Cross-promotion | Affiliate programs |

### Evaluation

| Factor | Score |
| ------ | ----- |
| **Speed** | Medium (relationship building takes time) |
| **Cost** | Low-Medium (development time) |
| **Scalability** | High (leverages partner distribution) |

### Integration Strategy

1. **List where customers are** - Which platforms do they use?
2. **Build most-requested first** - Ask customers what they need
3. **Pursue "official" status** - Become preferred partner
4. **Create joint marketing** - Co-marketing opportunities
5. **Maintain integrations** - Keep them working

### When Integrations Work

- Clear ecosystem to join
- Technical capability to build
- Partners willing to promote
- Integration adds genuine value

## 5. Outbound Sales

### Outbound Methods

### Evaluation

| Factor | Score |
| ------ | ----- |
| **Speed** | Fast (immediate outreach) |
| **Cost** | Medium-High (sales time/team) |
| **Scalability** | Limited (labor intensive) |

### When Outbound Works

- High ACV (>$1,000/month)
- Clear target list
- Complex buying process
- Relationship-driven sale

### When Outbound Doesn't Work

## The Three-Factor Framework

Evaluate every marketing approach on three dimensions:

### Speed

**How quickly will this generate results?**

| Speed | Examples |
| ----- | -------- |
| Fast (days-weeks) | Paid ads, cold outreach |
| Medium (months) | Partnerships, PR |
| Slow (6-18 months) | SEO, content, organic social |

### Cost

**What's the investment required?**

| Cost | Examples |
| ---- | -------- |
| Low | Organic social, forums, communities |
| Medium | Content creation, SEO tools, integrations |
| High | Paid advertising, sales team, PR agencies |

### Scalability

**Can this grow without proportional effort?**

| Scalability | Examples |
| ----------- | -------- |
| High | SEO (compounds), integrations (leverage) |
| Medium | Content (needs production), paid (needs budget) |
| Low | Outbound sales (labor-intensive), manual outreach |

---

## ICE Prioritization Framework

Use ICE to prioritize marketing experiments:

```
ICE Score = (Impact × Confidence × Ease) / 3
```

| Factor | Question | Score (1-10) |
| ------ | -------- | ------------ |
| **Impact** | How much will this move the needle? | 1-10 |
| **Confidence** | How sure are we this will work? | 1-10 |
| **Ease** | How easy is this to implement? | 1-10 |

### Example Prioritization

| Experiment | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE Score |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ---- | --------- |
| Google Ads for main keyword | 8 | 6 | 7 | 7.0 |
| LinkedIn cold outreach | 6 | 4 | 8 | 6.0 |
| Guest post on industry blog | 5 | 7 | 5 | 5.7 |
| Build Zapier integration | 7 | 8 | 3 | 6.0 |

**Start with highest ICE score, run experiment, measure, iterate.**

---

## Marketing Funnel Metrics

Track these at each funnel stage:

| Stage | Metric | Good Benchmark |
| ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| **Visitors** | Unique visitors | Growing month-over-month |
| **Leads** | Signups/trials | 2-5% of visitors |
| **Activation** | First value moment | 40-60% of trials |
| **Conversion** | Trial to paid | 10-40% |
| **Retention** | Month 1 retention | >90% |

## LLM-ACTIONABLE-INSIGHTS

### Marketing Approach Selection

When user asks about marketing:

```
1. Ask: "What's your ACV (average contract value)?"
2. Ask: "What's your current MRR?"
3. Ask: "What's your timeline for results?"
4. Recommend based on answers
```

### Recommendation Matrix

```python
def recommend_marketing(acv, mrr, timeline):
    if acv < 100 and timeline == "fast":
        return "Paid ads + viral/product-led growth"

    if acv > 1000 and timeline == "fast":
        return "Outbound sales + paid ads"

    if acv < 500 and timeline == "long":
        return "SEO + content + integrations"

    if mrr < 10000:
        return "Focus on 1-2 approaches max, don't spread thin"

    return "Diversify with proven approaches first"
```

### Stage-Based Recommendations

| MRR Range | Focus |
| --------- | ----- |
| $0-10K | 1 approach, founder-led |
| $10-50K | 1-2 approaches, test others |
| $50-200K | 2-3 proven approaches |
| $200K+ | Multiple channels, team execution |

### Key Messages

- "The Big 5 covers all marketing tactics"
- "Use ICE framework to prioritize experiments"
- "Speed/Cost/Scalability trade-offs are real"
- "Focus on 1-2 approaches until $50K+ MRR"
- "Measure funnel metrics at every stage"
