# Founders and Management

## Cofounder Considerations

> "The most equity you will ever give away is to your cofounder."

### Do You Need a Cofounder?

**Statistics:** 56% of bootstrapped SaaS founders are solo founders.

| Single Founder | Cofounder |
| -------------- | --------- |
| Full control | Shared decision-making |
| All the work | Distributed workload |
| All the equity | Split equity |
| Lonely journey | Partner in trenches |
| Simple | Complex interpersonal dynamics |

### When Cofounders Work

| Condition | Why It Matters |
| --------- | -------------- |
| **Complementary skills** | Developer + Marketer covers both bases |
| **Deep relationship** | Trust built over years, not weeks |
| **Shared vision** | Agreement on goals and approach |
| **Equity vesting** | Protection if things don't work out |

### When Cofounders Fail

| Problem | Outcome |
| ------- | ------- |
| Too much skill overlap | Arguments over same territory |
| Not knowing them well | Surprises under stress |
| No vesting | Founder leaves with equity |
| Misaligned goals | One wants exit, one wants lifestyle |

### Too Many Founders

**Three or four founders** often means:
- Too many opinions
- Diluted ownership
- One weak link
- Slower decision-making

> "If you're in this situation, you may already know in your gut who isn't pulling their weight."

## Founder Skill Development

### For Technical Founders

> "Developers are gonna develop. If your sole focus is product, you'll try to solve every business problem by building more features."

**The challenge:**
- Coding is deep work (Maker's Schedule)
- Founder work is meetings and decisions (Manager's Schedule)
- Can't do both effectively

**Recommendation:**
Start hiring developers to get out of the code. Build skills in sales and marketing.

### For Non-Technical Founders

**Statistics:** 90% of bootstrapped SaaS companies have at least one technical founder.

**If no technical cofounder:**
- Find a developer you trust (think of them as cofounder)
- Expect to pay well
- Technical decisions will have major impact on future
- Consider finding a developer cofounder

## Building Team Culture

### Be a Team, Not a Family

> "Calling your employees family is disingenuous. You don't fire your sister."

**Team mindset:**
- Support each other
- Work toward company success
- Make decisions for the company
- High performers thrive
- Underperformers are addressed

**Family mindset problems:**
- Can't make hard decisions
- Enmeshed relationships
- Protect poor performers
- Boundaries blur

### Hiring and Performance Standards

> "If you hire and tolerate mediocre performance, you will lose your best people."

**A-players want:**
- To work with other A-players
- Excellence valued
- Poor performance addressed
- Growth opportunities
- No "carrying" dead weight

## Management Hierarchy

### Supervision vs. Leadership

| Supervisor | Leader |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Approves vacation | Gives technical guidance |
| Gives reviews | Provides mentorship |
| Decides salaries | Sets direction |
| Handles HR matters | Guides decisions |

**A Manager** combines both supervision and leadership.

**Early stage:** Founders often split these roles (tech lead handles technical direction, founder handles HR).

### Levels of Thinkers

| Level | Characteristics | When to Hire |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------ |
| **Task-level** | Focuses on current/next task | Early hires |
| **Project-level** | Juggles multiple priorities, plans ahead | $20-40K MRR |
| **Owner-level** | Improves processes, strategic thinking | Growth stage |

### When to Hire Managers

| Team Size | Recommendation |
| --------- | -------------- |
| 1-2 in department | No manager needed |
| 2-3 in department | Find a lead (technical direction) |
| 4-5 in department | Hire/promote to manager |
| 6+ in department | Need manager + possible lead |

**Warning:** More than 10-12 direct reports is too many to manage well.

## Managing People

### What Good Managers Do

1. **Build trust** - Foundation of all management
2. **Give feedback** - Both positive and constructive
3. **Remove blockers** - Help team do their best work
4. **Develop people** - Career growth and skills
5. **Make decisions** - Don't dodge hard choices

### Giving Feedback

> "Praise in public, correct in private."

**For constructive feedback:**
- One-on-one setting only
- Specific examples
- Focus on behavior, not person
- Clear expectations going forward
- Document if recurring

**The "too nice" problem:**
- If you never give negative feedback, people don't know problems exist
- When you finally have to fire someone, they're shocked
- Trust breaks when people learn others were let go without warning

### One-on-One Meetings

| Element | Recommendation |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Frequency | Weekly or bi-weekly |
| Duration | 30-60 minutes |
| Owner | Employee sets agenda |
| Focus | Their concerns, growth, blockers |
| Documentation | Light notes on action items |

## Common Management Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Avoiding Difficult Conversations

**Result:** Problems fester, team morale suffers, eventual firing is messy.

**Solution:** Address issues early and directly.

### Mistake 2: Promoting Best Individual Contributor

**Result:** Lose great IC, gain mediocre manager.

**Solution:** Assess management desire and aptitude, not just performance.

### Mistake 3: Too Many Direct Reports

**Result:** Can't give anyone proper attention, everyone suffers.

**Solution:** Hire managers earlier than feels comfortable.

### Mistake 4: Micromanagement

**Result:** Talented people leave, you stay stuck in details.

**Solution:** Hire people you trust, give them ownership.

## LLM-ACTIONABLE-INSIGHTS

### Cofounder Assessment

When user asks about cofounders:

```python
def assess_cofounder_need(situation):
    if solo_founder_succeeding:
        return "You don't need a cofounder. Consider mastermind instead."

    if clear_skill_gap and deep_relationship_available:
        return "Cofounder could help. Ensure vesting and alignment."

    if struggling_alone:
        ask = "What specific gap would a cofounder fill?"
        # Often the answer is hiring, not cofounder
```

### Management Readiness

```
IF team_size < 4:
    "No managers needed yet. Founder manages directly."

ELIF team_size 4-8:
    "Time for leads in each area. Consider first manager."

ELIF team_size > 8:
    "Managers required. >12 reports per manager is too many."
```

### Key Questions to Ask

1. "How many people report directly to you?"
2. "When's the last time you gave someone constructive feedback?"
3. "Do you have regular 1-on-1s with your team?"
4. "What level thinkers are on your team (task/project/owner)?"

### Key Messages

- "Cofounders are optional—56% are solo founders"
- "Be a team, not a family"
- "Technical founders should get out of the code eventually"
- "Praise in public, correct in private"
- "Good managers build trust through honest feedback"
