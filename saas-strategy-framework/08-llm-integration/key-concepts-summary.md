# SaaS Strategy Framework: Key Concepts Summary

## Purpose

This document provides LLMs with a comprehensive summary of The SaaS Playbook framework for helping users build bootstrapped SaaS companies. Use this as a reference when advising on SaaS strategy, planning, and execution.

---

## Core Philosophy

### Bootstrapping Mindset
- **"Build your business, not your slide deck"**
- Permission not required to start—just ship
- Revenue is the ultimate validation
- Bootstrappers don't run out of money, they run out of motivation
- Focus on capital efficiency and sustainable growth

### Why SaaS
- Recurring revenue compounds
- Recession-resistant
- High profit margins (~90% gross)
- High exit multiples (4-8x revenue)
- Not dependent on luck like social/marketplace startups
- Funding optional, not required

### Stair Step Method
1. **Step 1:** Simple product, single channel (WordPress plugin, Shopify app)
2. **Step 2:** Repeat and scale what works
3. **Step 3:** Standalone SaaS (this framework)

---

## Market Strategy

### Product-Market Fit
- Definition: Built something businesses want AND will pay for
- Starts weak around $10-20K MRR, strengthens over time
- **Escape Velocity** = PMF + Repeatable Growth Channels

### Feature Prioritization
- **Crackpots:** Ignore (doesn't align with vision)
- **No-Brainers:** Build immediately (core customer needs)
- **In-Betweens:** Evaluate by quantity and quality of requests

### Moats (Competitive Advantages)
1. Brand (takes years)
2. Integrations (compounds with usage)
3. Scale (economies improve)
4. Network effects (users attract users)
5. Switching costs (painful to leave)
6. Content/SEO (hard to replicate)

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Structure Options
1. Single price (simple but leaves money on table)
2. Value metrics (recommended—scales with success)
3. Feature gating (clear tiers)
4. Hybrid (maximum revenue capture)

### Key Pricing Rules
- **"If not embarrassed by price, probably too cheap"**
- Three plans is standard (Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
- **Always require credit card for trials** (2-3x conversion)
- Offer 16-17% annual discount (2 months free)
- Freemium rarely works for bootstrapped B2B

### Expansion Revenue (SaaS Cheat Code)
- Price should increase as customer gets more value
- Value metrics tied to customer success
- Target: 3-5% monthly expansion rate
- **Net Negative Churn** = Growth without new customers

### Raising Prices
- Most founders are underpriced
- 10% price increase > 10% more customers (higher profit margin)
- Methods: New customers only, grandfather existing, raise all
- Some churn acceptable if revenue nets positive

## Marketing & Growth

### Big 5 Marketing Approaches
1. **SEO** - Slow, low cost, high scalability
2. **Content** - Slow, medium cost, high scalability
3. **Paid Ads** - Fast, high cost, medium scalability
4. **Integrations/Partnerships** - Medium speed, low-medium cost, high scalability
5. **Outbound Sales** - Fast, medium-high cost, low scalability

### Three-Factor Framework
Evaluate each approach on:
- **Speed:** How quickly results come
- **Cost:** Investment required
- **Scalability:** Can it grow without proportional effort

### ICE Prioritization
```
ICE Score = (Impact × Confidence × Ease) / 3
```

### Funnel Types
- **Low-touch:** Self-serve, <$500/month products
- **High-touch:** Demo-driven, >$500/month products
- **Dual Funnel (SaaS Cheat Code):** Offer both—capture entire market

---

## Team Building

### Hiring Sequence
- **Delegate roles, not tasks**
- Typical first hire: Customer Support
- Then: Sales, Marketing, or Development (depends on founder skills)
- Hire for what you're bad at or don't enjoy

### Role Combinations That Work
- Support + Success (both customer-facing)
- Marketing + Sales (both revenue-focused)
- Engineering + DevOps (both technical)

### Management Principles
- **"Be a team, not a family"** (can make hard decisions)
- **"Hire slow, fire fast"**
- Don't invent job titles—use standard ones
- Leads at 2-3 people, managers at 4-5 people

### Cofounder Considerations
- 56% of bootstrapped SaaS are solo founders
- Cofounders optional, not required
- If partnering: complementary skills, deep relationship, vesting

---

## SaaS Metrics (80/20)

### North Star Metrics
1. **MRR** (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
2. **Month-over-Month Growth Rate**

### 3 High / 3 Low Framework

**3 LOW (Minimize):**
1. **CAC** - Cost to Acquire Customer (target: 2-6 month payback)
2. **Sales Effort** - Time/touches to close
3. **Churn** - Revenue lost (target: <5%, ideally <3%)

**3 HIGH (Maximize):**
1. **ACV** - Annual Contract Value
2. **Expansion Revenue** - Upgrades from existing customers
3. **Referrals** - New customers from existing ones

### Critical Formula: Plateau Calculator
```
Plateau Revenue = New Monthly MRR / Churn Rate

Example: $5,000 new MRR / 10% churn = $50,000 plateau
```

### Churn Segmentation
- By pricing tier (low tiers churn more)
- By marketing channel (some channels have lower LTV)
- By cohort/time (first 60 days highest)

### SaaS Cheat Codes
1. **Expansion Revenue** - Growth from existing customers
2. **Net Negative Churn** - Expansion > Churn
3. **Dual Funnels** - Self-serve + Sales-assisted
4. **Virality** - Users bring users

## Founder Mindset

### Success Factors
- **Hard work** (controllable)
- **Skill** (developable)
- **Luck** (influenceable through positioning)

### Key Traits
1. Bias toward action
2. Developed founder gut
3. Manage own psychology

### Risk vs. Certainty
- **Certainties:** Delegate (tasks you know how to do)
- **Risks:** Focus (unknowns that require founder thinking)

### Efficiency vs. Effectiveness
- Efficiency = Doing things right
- Effectiveness = Doing right things (more important)

### Speed Bumps vs. Roadblocks
- Most "roadblocks" are actually speed bumps
- Always have Plan B, C, D (optionality thinking)
- True roadblocks are rare

### Burnout Prevention
- Hire out of "burnout zone" (tasks you're good at but hate)
- Schedule recovery time (daily, weekly, quarterly)
- Build support systems (mastermind, mentor, community)
- Take founder retreats (48-72 hours of reflection)

### Community & Support
- Masterminds: 3-5 peers, weekly/bi-weekly
- Mentors: 1-2 maximum (more = noise)
- Communities: MicroConf, Indie Hackers, Dynamite Circle

---

## Funding Considerations

### Bootstrapped vs. Raised
- Funding is a tool, not a requirement
- Small raises ($100-500K) can save years
- Don't raise before PMF
- Don't torch your cap table (give away too much)

### When Raising Helps
- Clear deployment plan
- Time-sensitive market opportunity
- Can "live in the future" (hire senior, invest in compliance)

### When to Avoid
- No clear plan for money
- Before product-market fit
- Raising to avoid hard decisions

---

## Quick Decision Frameworks

### Pricing Decision
```
IF never raised prices → Probably underpriced, test 20% increase
IF high conversion, low complaints → Room to increase
IF competitors 2x higher → Consider significant increase
```

### Marketing Channel Selection
```
IF ACV < $300 → Low-touch, self-serve focus
IF ACV > $1,000 → High-touch, sales-driven
IF $300-1,000 → Dual funnel opportunity
```

### Hiring Decision
```
IF MRR < $10K → Focus on PMF, contractors only
IF overwhelmed with support → Support first hire
IF founder technical + marketing weak → Hire marketing
IF founder marketing + dev bottleneck → Hire developer
```

### Churn Diagnosis
```
IF churn > 8% → Business-threatening, immediate action
IF churn in first 60 days → Onboarding problem
IF churn higher in low tiers → Segment may not fit
IF churn from competitor → Analyze differentiation
```
