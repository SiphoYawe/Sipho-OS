# Product-Market Fit

## Definition

**Product-market fit** = You've built something businesses want AND are willing to pay for.

It's not binary—PMF exists on a spectrum from weak to strong. Weak PMF typically starts around $10-20K MRR and strengthens over time as you build moats and defend territory.

## How to Find Product-Market Fit

### The Golden Rule

> "The best ideas come from scratching your own itch. Building to satisfy your own needs is the surest route to product-market fit."

### Three Questions to Start

1. **Do you have a problem worth solving?**
   - Is it painful enough that people will pay?
   - Is it recurring (SaaS opportunity)?
   - Can you reach these people?

2. **Who has this problem?**
   - Specific market segment
   - Defined characteristics
   - Reachable audience

3. **Can you build a solution?**
   - Technical feasibility
   - Your expertise
   - Resource availability

## Understanding Your Market

### Customer Conversations

Before building, talk to potential customers:

**How to Start Conversations:**
- "I'm researching [problem/industry], would love to learn about your experience"
- Focus on their pain, not your solution
- Listen more than you talk

**Questions to Ask:**
1. How do you currently solve this problem?
2. What's the most frustrating part?
3. How much time/money do you spend on this?
4. If a solution existed, what would it need to do?
5. How much would you pay for that?

### Red Flags in Customer Conversations

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|--------------|
| "That sounds nice" | Polite but not interested |
| No time commitment | Problem isn't painful enough |
| "I'd use it if it was free" | Not willing to pay |
| Vague enthusiasm | Courtesy, not validation |

### Green Flags

| Green Flag | What It Means |
|------------|--------------|
| "When can I get it?" | Real urgency |
| "Can I pay you now?" | Strong intent |
| Detailed questions | Evaluating seriously |
| Sharing specific pain points | Problem is real |

## The Feature Request Framework

Once you have customers, you'll receive constant feature requests. Manage them with this prioritization system:

### Three Feature Buckets

| Bucket | Definition | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Crackpots** | Doesn't align with your vision | Ignore completely |
| **No-Brainers** | Core features needed for core customers | Build immediately |
| **In-Betweens** | Useful but not critical | Evaluate by quantity and quality |

### Evaluating In-Betweens

**Quantity Questions:**
- How many customers requested this?
- What percentage of total customers?
- Is it growing or one-time request?

**Quality Questions:**
- Is it from ideal customers (high-paying, long-term)?
- Is it from your target segment?
- Does it align with product direction?

```
FEW requests from NON-IDEAL customers → Ignore
FEW requests from IDEAL customers → Monitor
MANY requests from NON-IDEAL customers → Analyze why
MANY requests from IDEAL customers → Prioritize building
```

## Common Mistakes Killing PMF

### Mistake 1: Building Before Talking

**Wrong:**
```
Idea → Build for 6 months → Launch → No customers → Pivot → Repeat
```

**Right:**
```
Idea → Talk to 20 customers → Validate → MVP → Iterate with feedback
```

### Mistake 2: Listening to Wrong Customers

Not all customers are equal:
- **Ideal customers**: High-paying, low-churn, low-maintenance
- **Non-ideal customers**: Low-paying, high-churn, high-maintenance

Build for ideal customers, even if you have to fire the others.

### Mistake 3: Feature Bloat

> "If your product is all things to all people, it is not compelling to anyone."

**Signs of Feature Bloat:**
- Adding features to win deals you shouldn't want
- Product complexity growing faster than value
- Customers confused about core value proposition
- Engineering time spread too thin

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Churn Feedback

Every churned customer is a PMF data point:

**Exit Survey Questions:**
1. Why did you cancel?
2. What would have kept you?
3. What are you switching to?
4. What was missing?

## Signs You Have PMF

### Early PMF Indicators (Weak)

- $10-20K MRR achieved
- Customer retention improving
- Organic referrals starting
- Less "selling" needed, more "explaining"

### Strong PMF Indicators

- Customers finding you (inbound growth)
- Low churn rate (<5% monthly)
- Customers upgrading naturally
- Word-of-mouth driving growth
- Competition copying you

### Escape Velocity = PMF + Growth Channels

**PMF alone is not enough:**
```
PMF (product people want) + Repeatable Growth = Escape Velocity
```

## Niche Selection Strategy

### Market Size Considerations

**Too Small:**
- Can't support meaningful business
- Limited expansion opportunities
- Easy to saturate quickly

**Too Large (for bootstrappers):**
- Attracts well-funded competitors
- Expensive to market
- Hard to differentiate

**Just Right:**
- Big enough to build $1-10M business
- Small enough that big players ignore
- Focused enough to dominate

### The Niche-Down Approach

```
General → Narrow → Specific → Dominate → Expand

Example:
"CRM" → "CRM for real estate" → "CRM for real estate teams" → Dominate → Expand features
```

### Evaluating a Niche

| Question | Good Answer | Bad Answer |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| How do you reach them? | Clear channels (communities, publications) | "Everyone with a computer" |
| What do they pay for? | Known spending patterns | "I think they might pay" |
| How big is the market? | $50M-500M TAM | Too small or too large |
| Who else serves them? | Few players, room for differentiation | Dominated by giants |

## LLM-ACTIONABLE-INSIGHTS

### PMF Assessment Questions

When user asks about their product:

1. **Revenue Check**
   - "What's your current MRR?"
   - "How long have you been at this level?"

2. **Customer Quality Check**
   - "Who are your best customers?"
   - "What do they have in common?"

3. **Churn Check**
   - "What's your monthly churn rate?"
   - "Why do customers leave?"

4. **Growth Check**
   - "How do customers find you?"
   - "What percentage is organic/referral?"

### PMF Diagnosis Framework

```
IF MRR < $5K:
    Focus on: Getting any paying customers
    Message: "Talk to more potential customers"

ELIF MRR $5-20K AND high_churn (>10%):
    Focus on: Understanding why customers leave
    Message: "PMF is weak, iterate on core value"

ELIF MRR $5-20K AND low_churn (<5%):
    Focus on: Finding growth channels
    Message: "PMF exists, find repeatable acquisition"

ELIF MRR > $20K AND growing:
    Focus on: Strengthening moats, scaling growth
    Message: "Moving toward escape velocity"
```

### Feature Request Response

When user asks about building features:

```
1. Ask: "Which bucket does this fit? Crackpot, No-Brainer, or In-Between?"
2. If In-Between: "How many ideal customers requested this?"
3. Recommend: "If 10+ ideal customers want it, prioritize. Otherwise, monitor."
```
