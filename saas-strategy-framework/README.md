## Quick Reference

### The SaaS Journey

```
IDEA → VALIDATION → BUILD → PMF → ESCAPE VELOCITY → SCALE
        │              │       │         │            │
        │              │       │         │            └─ Multiple channels, team, moats
        │              │       │         └─ PMF + Repeatable growth
        │              │       └─ $10-20K MRR, weak but real PMF
        │              └─ MVP, first customers
        └─ Customer conversations, pre-selling
```

### Key Metrics Dashboard

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------ |
| Monthly churn | < 3% | > 8% is crisis |
| CAC payback | 2-6 months | > 12 months danger |
| MoM growth | 5-10% | < 3% is stalling |
| Expansion rate | 3-5% | Enables net negative churn |

### SaaS Cheat Codes

1. **Expansion Revenue** - Customers pay more as they get more value
2. **Net Negative Churn** - Expansion exceeds churn (grow without new customers)
3. **Dual Funnels** - Self-serve AND sales-assisted (capture entire market)
4. **Virality** - Users bring more users

## Core Frameworks

### 1. The 3 High / 3 Low Metrics

**Minimize (LOW):**
- **CAC** - Cost to Acquire Customer
- **Sales Effort** - Time/touches to close
- **Churn** - Revenue lost monthly

**Maximize (HIGH):**
- **ACV** - Annual Contract Value
- **Expansion Revenue** - Upgrades from existing customers
- **Referrals** - New customers from word-of-mouth

### 2. The Big 5 Marketing Approaches

| Approach | Speed | Cost | Scalability |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| SEO | Slow | Low | High |
| Content | Slow | Medium | High |
| Paid Ads | Fast | High | Medium |
| Integrations | Medium | Low-Medium | High |
| Outbound Sales | Fast | Medium-High | Low |

### 3. The Plateau Formula

```
Plateau Revenue = New Monthly MRR / Churn Rate

Example: $5,000 new MRR ÷ 10% churn = $50,000 maximum MRR
```

This tells you where growth will stall unless you reduce churn or increase acquisition.

### 4. ICE Prioritization

For evaluating marketing experiments and features:

```
ICE Score = (Impact × Confidence × Ease) / 3

Score each factor 1-10, prioritize highest ICE scores first.
```

## Decision Frameworks

### Pricing Decision Tree

```
Have clear value metric? (seats, contacts, API calls)
├── YES → Use value-based pricing (scales with success)
└── NO
    ├── Have distinct customer segments?
    │   ├── YES → Feature gating with 3 tiers
    │   └── NO → Consider single price or 2 simple tiers
    └── END

ALWAYS: Require credit card for trials (2-3x conversion)
ALWAYS: Offer annual discount (16-17% or 2 months free)
```

### Marketing Channel Selection

```
What's your ACV?
├── < $300/month → Low-touch (self-serve, product-led)
├── > $1,000/month → High-touch (sales, demos)
└── $300-1,000 → Dual funnel opportunity

What's your timeline?
├── Need fast results → Paid ads, outbound sales
└── Can invest long-term → SEO, content, integrations
```

### Hiring Priority

```
Track time for 1-2 weeks, then ask:
1. What am I bad at that someone else could do better?
2. What am I good at but don't enjoy?
3. What could I stop doing without negative impact?
4. What, if leveled up, would most grow the company?

Typical sequence: Support → Sales/Marketing → Development → Management
```

## Key Principles

### On Building
- Build something businesses want AND will pay for
- Ship fast, iterate based on feedback
- Focus on PMF before scaling

### On Pricing
- If not embarrassed by your price, probably too cheap
- Value metrics enable expansion revenue
- Raise prices more often than you think

### On Marketing
- Focus on 1-2 approaches until $50K MRR
- Dual funnels capture entire market
- Measure every funnel stage

### On Team
- Delegate roles, not tasks
- Be a team, not a family
- Hire slow, fire fast

### On Metrics
- MRR + Growth Rate are your North Stars
- Segment churn—averages hide insights
- Calculate your plateau number

### On Mindset
- Managing psychology is half the battle
- Speed bumps, not roadblocks
- Build support systems (masterminds, mentors)
