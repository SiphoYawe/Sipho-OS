## Quick Reference

### The Core Formula

```
EFFECTIVE LEARNING = (Active Recall × Spaced Repetition × Strategic Focus) / Time
```

### The Pareto Principle for Learning

```
Focus on the 20% of material that yields 80% of results
Focus on the 20% of techniques that produce 80% of retention
Focus on the 20% of effort that generates 80% of understanding
```

### The Five Pillars of Effective Learning

| Pillar | Description | Key Technique |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 1. Active Engagement | Force your brain to retrieve, not passively absorb | Active Recall |
| 2. Strategic Timing | Space out learning to fight the forgetting curve | Spaced Repetition |
| 3. Desirable Difficulty | Embrace struggle—it strengthens memory | Interleaved Practice |
| 4. Quality Over Quantity | Hours studied ≠ learning achieved | Pareto Principle |
| 5. System Design | Build environments and routines that automate success | Productivity Systems |

### Key Formulas

```
Study Session: "I will study [SUBJECT] using [TECHNIQUE] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"
Active Recall Question: "Without looking, what are the key points of [TOPIC]?"
Spaced Interval: Day 1 → Day 3 → Day 7 → Day 14 → Day 30
Pomodoro Block: 25 min focus + 5 min break (×4) + 15-30 min long break
Pareto Filter: "What 20% of this material is essential for 80% of understanding?"
```

### The Forgetting Curve Reality

```
Without review:
  After 1 hour: ~50% forgotten
  After 1 day: ~70% forgotten
  After 1 week: ~90% forgotten

With spaced repetition:
  Each review strengthens memory exponentially
  5 well-timed reviews > 20 cramming sessions
```

## Key Principles for Implementation

### The Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

Apply ruthless prioritization:
- Identify the 20% of concepts that explain 80% of the subject
- Focus on the 20% of techniques that produce 80% of retention
- Spend 80% of study time on active techniques, 20% on passive

### Active Over Passive

The hierarchy of learning effectiveness:
1. **Teaching others** (90% retention)
2. **Practice by doing** (75% retention)
3. **Discussion** (50% retention)
4. **Demonstration** (30% retention)
5. **Reading** (10% retention)
6. **Lecture** (5% retention)

### Spaced Repetition Schedule

Optimal review intervals:
```
Review 1: Same day (within 24 hours)
Review 2: Day 3
Review 3: Day 7
Review 4: Day 14
Review 5: Day 30
Review 6: Day 60 (if needed)
```

### Desirable Difficulty

Embrace productive struggle:
- Easy studying = weak memory
- Challenging retrieval = strong memory
- Interleaving > blocking
- Testing > re-reading

### Environment Design

Set up for success:
- Dedicated study space
- Phone in another room
- Materials prepared in advance
- Distractions eliminated at source

2. **Pain points** - What's not working?
3. **Goals** - What do they want to achieve?
4. **Constraints** - Time, resources, course type?
5. **Personality** - Structured vs. flexible approach?

## The Perfect Study Session Template

```
BEFORE (5 min):
□ Review: What do I already know about this topic?
□ Prime: Skim headings, generate questions
□ Intention: What specifically will I learn?

DURING (25-50 min):
□ Active engagement (not passive reading)
□ Generate questions as you go
□ Take sparse, question-based notes
□ Struggle before looking up answers

AFTER (10 min):
□ Close materials, recall everything
□ Write summary from memory
□ Create flashcards/questions
□ Schedule next review

SPACING:
□ Review tomorrow
□ Schedule Day 3, Day 7, Day 14 reviews
```

## Comparison with Atomic Habits Framework

| Aspect | Atomic Habits | Learning Framework |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Core Philosophy | 1% better daily, identity change | Pareto principle, active learning |
| Primary Framework | Four Laws of Behavior Change | Five Pillars of Effective Learning |
| Key Mechanism | Habit loop (Cue→Craving→Response→Reward) | Memory loop (Encode→Store→Retrieve→Strengthen) |
| Environment Focus | Cue visibility, friction | Distraction elimination, study space |
| Tracking | Habit streaks | Spaced repetition schedules |
| Common Pitfall | Missing twice | Passive studying |
| Success Metric | Automatic behavior | Deep understanding and retention |

Both frameworks share:
- Systems over goals approach
- Environment design importance
- Identity/mindset component
- Evidence-based strategies
- Compound growth effects
