# Weekly Review System: Staying On Track

## Overview

The weekly review system is your metacognitive dashboard—a regular practice of stepping back from daily execution to assess what's working, what's not, and what to adjust. Without this systematic reflection, you drift off course without realizing it until exam results force a reckoning.

**Core Principle**: What gets measured gets managed. Regular review prevents small problems from becoming big failures.

**Time Required**: 30-60 minutes per week (Sunday evening recommended)

**Goal**: Maintain trajectory toward goals, catch problems early, continuously optimize

---

## Why Weekly Review is Essential

### The Problem Without Weekly Review

**What happens without systematic review**:

**Week 1**: Start strong, follow system perfectly
**Week 2**: Miss one immediate review, no big deal
**Week 3**: Skip a few pretests, still feel fine
**Week 4**: Realize you're behind, panic
**Week 6**: Failed first exam, "I studied so hard, what happened?"

**The issue**: Slow drift goes unnoticed until crisis

**Research finding**: Students who do weekly reviews:
- Catch problems 3-4 weeks earlier
- Maintain study habits 2x better
- Achieve 10-15% higher grades
- Report less stress and more control

### What Weekly Review Prevents

**Academic drift**:
- System adherence declining without noticing
- Purple questions staying purple week after week
- Study time decreasing gradually
- Priorities getting confused

**Inefficiency**:
- Spending time on wrong topics (already know them)
- Neglecting high-value topics
- Using ineffective study methods
- Wasting hours on low-return activities

**Stress accumulation**:
- Small problems compound
- Deadlines creep up
- Overwhelm builds silently

**Weekly review catches all of this EARLY when it's fixable.**

## The Complete Weekly Review Protocol

### Timing: When to Do Your Weekly Review

**Recommended**: Sunday evening (5-7 PM)

**Why Sunday evening**:
- Week is fresh in memory (can recall what happened)
- Upcoming week is blank (can plan effectively)
- Psychologically marks end/beginning of week
- Sets you up for strong Monday start

**Alternative times**:
- Friday evening (end of academic week)
- Saturday morning (fresh start to weekend planning)
- Sunday afternoon (before week begins)

**Choose one time and stick with it.** Consistency matters more than optimal timing.

**Block it in calendar as non-negotiable** (like a class or work shift)

---

## Phase 1: Weekly Planning Session (15-20 minutes)

### Step 1: Review Upcoming Week's Classes (5 minutes)

**What to do**:
1. Open all course syllabi
2. Check what topics will be covered this week
3. Note any deadlines (assignments, quizzes, exams)
4. Identify any schedule changes (cancelled classes, extra sessions)

**Create weekly overview**:
```markdown
# Week of [Date]

## Classes This Week

### Monday
- 9 AM Biology: Cellular Respiration (Chapter 9)
- 11 AM Chemistry: Stoichiometry (Chapter 7)

### Tuesday
- 10 AM Biology Lab: Enzyme Kinetics
- 1 PM Statistics: Hypothesis Testing (Chapter 12)

### Wednesday
- 9 AM Biology: Photosynthesis (Chapter 10)
- 11 AM Chemistry: Limiting Reactants (Chapter 7 cont.)

### Thursday
- 1 PM Statistics: P-values and Confidence Intervals

### Friday

## Deadlines This Week
- [ ] Chemistry Problem Set 5 - Due Wednesday 11:59 PM
- [ ] Statistics Homework 8 - Due Friday 11:59 PM
- [ ] Biology Lab Report 3 - Due Sunday 11:59 PM

## Exams Coming Up
- Biology Exam 2 - October 15 (2 weeks away)
- Chemistry Exam 2 - October 20 (3 weeks away)
```

**Output**: Complete picture of what's coming

### Step 2: Schedule Study Blocks (10 minutes)

**What to do**:
1. Open calendar/planner
2. Block out fixed commitments (classes, work, meals, sleep)
3. Identify available study blocks
4. Assign specific topics to specific blocks
5. Use interleaving (alternate subjects)
6. Include breaks

**Principles**:
- **Specificity**: "Study biology" → "Review cellular respiration purple questions"
- **Realism**: Don't schedule 12 hours of study per day
- **Flexibility**: Leave 20% buffer time for unexpected
- **Interleaving**: Never same subject for >90 minutes

**Example weekly schedule**:
```markdown
## Study Schedule This Week

### Monday
- 10:15-11:00 AM: Biology immediate review (after class)
- 12:00-12:20 PM: Chemistry immediate review (after class)
- 3:00-4:00 PM: Biology spaced review (last week's material)
- 4:00-4:15 PM: Break
- 4:15-5:15 PM: Chemistry practice problems
- 7:00-8:00 PM: Statistics reading + pretest for Tuesday

### Tuesday
- 9:30-9:50 AM: Statistics pretest
- 11:00-11:20 AM: Biology lab immediate review
- 2:00-2:20 PM: Statistics immediate review
- 3:00-4:00 PM: Biology + Chemistry interleaved practice
- 7:00-8:30 PM: Work on Chemistry problem set

[Continue for all days...]

### Weekend
- Saturday AM: Biology exam prep (practice exam)
- Saturday PM: Chemistry + Statistics review
- Sunday AM: Biology exam prep (error analysis)
- Sunday PM: Weekly review + upcoming week planning
```

**Time allocation guideline**:
- Immediate reviews: ~20 min per class (non-negotiable)
- Spaced review: 15 min per subject, 2-3x per week
- Practice/problem sets: 60-90 min per subject per week
- Exam prep: Additional 2-5 hours per week (when exams coming)
- Total: ~20-25 hours per week for typical 15-credit load

### Step 3: Identify Priority Topics (5 minutes)

**What to do**:
1. Review retrospective timetable (color-coded questions from last week)
2. Identify topics still purple or blue
3. Rank by priority:
   - **HIGH**: Purple topics + upcoming exam topics + foundational concepts
   - **MEDIUM**: Blue topics + assignment-related topics
   - **LOW**: Black topics (just spaced review)

**Create priority list**:
```markdown
## Priority Topics This Week

### HIGH PRIORITY (60% of study time)
- [ ] Cellular respiration (still 40% purple from last week)
- [ ] Stoichiometry calculations (purple, needed for this week's problem set)
- [ ] Hypothesis testing (new material, foundational for stats)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (30% of study time)
- [ ] Enzyme kinetics (blue, lab-related)
- [ ] Limiting reactants (blue, builds on stoichiometry)
- [ ] P-values (new material, medium importance)

### LOW PRIORITY (10% of study time)
- [ ] Cell membrane structure (black, just maintain)
- [ ] Basic statistical definitions (black, just maintain)
```

**This ensures you spend time on what matters most.**

---

## Phase 2: Daily Quick Review (5 minutes per day)

**When**: Each morning or evening

**What to do**:
1. Check today's schedule (classes, study blocks, deadlines)
2. Verify you have materials ready (readings, assignments)
3. Adjust if needed (unexpected event, take longer than planned)

**Example morning check**:
```markdown
## Monday Morning Check

Today's schedule:
✓ 9 AM Biology - ready (did pretest yesterday)
✓ 11 AM Chemistry - ready (pretest at 10:30)
✓ 3-5 PM study block - know what I'm working on
! Assignment due Wednesday - need to start today

Adjustments:
- Add 30 min tonight for starting Chemistry problem set
- Move tomorrow's reading to tonight (free time available)
```

**Takes 5 minutes, prevents surprises and stress**

---

## Phase 3: End-of-Week Reflection (30-40 minutes)

This is the core of the weekly review system.

### Step 1: System Adherence Check (10 minutes)

**What to do**: Review how well you followed the study system this week

**Questions to ask**:

**Before-class (Pretesting)**:
- [ ] How many classes had pretests? [X/Y]
- [ ] Adherence rate: [%] (target: 80%+)
- [ ] Why did I skip pretests? [Reasons]

**During-class (Question-based notes)**:
- [ ] How many lectures used question-based notes? [X/Y]
- [ ] Average questions per lecture: [X] (target: 20-40)
- [ ] Did I write only questions (not transcribe)? [Y/N per lecture]

**After-class (Immediate review)**:
- [ ] How many immediate reviews completed? [X/Y]
- [ ] Adherence rate: [%] (target: 90%+)
- [ ] Reviews within 2 hours of class? [X/Y]
- [ ] Why did I skip? [Reasons]

**End-of-day review**:
- [ ] How many end-of-day reviews? [X/Y days]
- [ ] Adherence rate: [%] (target: 80%+)

**Spaced repetition**:
- [ ] Did I review material from 3 days ago? [Y/N]
- [ ] Did I review material from 1 week ago? [Y/N]
- [ ] Did I review material from 2 weeks ago? [Y/N]

**Environment**:
- [ ] Phone in different room during study? [X/Y sessions]
- [ ] Website blocker active? [X/Y sessions]
- [ ] Studied in consistent location? [X/Y sessions]

**Overall adherence**: [%]

**Calculation**: (Steps completed / Steps planned) × 100

**Example**:
```
This week:
- 8/8 classes: immediate reviews (100%) ✓
- 6/8 classes: pretests (75%) - IMPROVE
- 8/8 lectures: question-based notes (100%) ✓
- 5/7 days: end-of-day review (71%) - IMPROVE
- 7/10 study sessions: phone in different room (70%) - IMPROVE

Overall adherence: 83%
Target: 90%
Gap: 7 percentage points

Actions:
1. Set pretest reminder alarm (30 min before class)
2. Schedule end-of-day review in calendar (9:30 PM daily)
3. Put phone lockbox on desk (visual reminder)
```

### Step 2: Learning Progress Assessment (10 minutes)

**What to do**: Review color-coded questions to see actual learning progress

**Color distribution analysis**:

**Count questions by color** (from retrospective timetable):

**Last week**:
- BLACK: 45 questions (35%)
- BLUE: 50 questions (38%)
- PURPLE: 35 questions (27%)

**This week**:
- BLACK: 60 questions (43%)
- BLUE: 48 questions (34%)
- PURPLE: 32 questions (23%)

**Progress indicators**:
- BLACK increased: 35% → 43% (+8%) ✓ Good
- PURPLE decreased: 27% → 23% (-4%) ✓ Good
- Net improvement: YES

**Topic-by-topic tracking**:
```markdown
### Biology
Last week: 40% purple, 35% blue, 25% black
This week: 30% purple, 40% blue, 30% black
Trend: Improving (purple decreasing, black increasing)

### Chemistry
Last week: 20% purple, 40% blue, 40% black
This week: 25% purple, 45% blue, 30% black
Trend: DECLINING (purple increasing, black decreasing)
Action needed: Something's not working in Chemistry study

### Statistics
Last week: 30% purple, 35% blue, 35% black
This week: 15% purple, 30% blue, 55% black
Trend: Strong improvement
Keep doing what I'm doing for Stats
```

**Key questions**:
- [ ] Are purple questions becoming blue? (If no → adjust method)
- [ ] Are blue questions becoming black? (If no → need more practice)
- [ ] Are old black questions staying black? (If no → need spaced review)
- [ ] Which topics show no improvement? (Needs intervention)

### Step 3: Effectiveness Analysis (10 minutes)

**What to do**: Reflect on what's working and what's not

**Questions to answer**:

**What worked well this week?**
```
Examples:
- Pretesting for Biology made lectures much easier to follow
- Immediate reviews in library (not at home) were more effective
- Interleaving Chemistry and Physics helped distinguish concepts
- Study group for Statistics cleared up confusion quickly
```

**What didn't work?**
```
Examples:
- Studying late at night led to poor retention
- Skipping breaks led to burnout on Thursday
- Chemistry problem set took 2x longer than planned
- Noise in coffee shop was too distracting
```

**What surprised me?**
```
Examples:
- I remembered Biology material better than I thought
- Chemistry concepts I thought were black turned out purple on practice problems
- Studying in morning (not evening) was much more productive
- Taking notes by hand worked better than laptop
```

**What challenges did I face?**
```
Examples:
- Ran out of time for Wednesday's immediate review
- Got stuck on Chemistry problem set, wasted 2 hours being frustrated
- Felt overwhelmed on Thursday with 3 deadlines
- Sleep deprived after late night studying Tuesday
```

**What do I need help with?**
```
Examples:
- Still don't understand electron transport chain (Biology)
- Confused about when to use t-test vs z-test (Statistics)
- Time management for problem sets (taking too long)
- Test anxiety increasing as exam approaches
```

### Step 4: Grade Tracking and Adjustment (5 minutes)

**What to do**: Track all grades and overall performance

**Create grade tracking sheet**:
```markdown
# Grade Tracker: Fall Semester

## Biology (Target: A, 90%+)
| Assignment | Score | Average | Trend |
|------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Exam 1 | 88/100 (88%) | 85% | - |
| Quiz 1 | 9/10 (90%) | 88% | ↑ |
| Quiz 2 | 8/10 (80%) | 86% | ↓ |
| Lab 1 | 95/100 (95%) | 88% | ↑ |
| Homework 1 | 100/100 | 90% | ↑ |

Current grade: 90% (A-)
On track: YES
Adjustment needed: Maintain current approach

## Chemistry (Target: B+, 87%+)
| Assignment | Score | Average | Trend |
|------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Exam 1 | 75/100 (75%) | 75% | - |
| Quiz 1 | 7/10 (70%) | 73% | ↓ |
| Problem Set 1 | 85/100 | 77% | ↑ |
| Problem Set 2 | 80/100 | 78% | ↑ |

Current grade: 78% (C+)
On track: NO (target B+, currently C+)
Adjustment needed: YES - increase study time, seek tutoring

## Statistics (Target: A, 90%+)
[Similar format...]
```

**Analysis questions**:
- [ ] Am I on track for my target grade in each course?
- [ ] Which courses are trending up vs. down?
- [ ] Where do I need to adjust effort allocation?
- [ ] Are my grades reflecting my study effort (or not)?

**Adjustment decisions**:
```
Chemistry (currently C+, target B+):
- Increase study time from 4 hrs/week to 6 hrs/week
- Attend TA office hours weekly
- Form study group for problem sets
- Do extra practice problems beyond assignments
- Review this in 2 weeks (after next exam)

Biology (on track at A-):
- Maintain current approach
- No changes needed

Statistics (exceeding target at A):
- Maintain current approach
- Could potentially reduce time slightly if needed elsewhere
```

### Step 5: Action Planning (5 minutes)

**What to do**: Based on all the above analysis, create specific action items for next week

**Format**:
```markdown
# Action Items for Next Week

## Continue (What's working)
- [ ] Immediate reviews in library (not at home)
- [ ] Morning study sessions (more productive)
- [ ] Pretesting for Biology (makes lectures easier)
- [ ] Statistics study group on Thursdays

## Start (New approaches to try)
- [ ] Chemistry TA office hours Tuesday 2 PM
- [ ] Extra 30 min per day on Chemistry practice problems
- [ ] Set alarm for pretests (improve adherence)
- [ ] Sleep by 11 PM every night (was too late this week)

## Stop (What's not working)
- [ ] Stop studying in coffee shop (too noisy)
- [ ] Stop late-night cramming (ineffective and ruins sleep)
- [ ] Stop skipping breaks (leads to burnout)
- [ ] Stop procrastinating on problem sets (start earlier)

## Adjust (Modifications)
- [ ] Move Chemistry study to morning (not evening)
- [ ] Increase Chemistry time: 4 hrs → 6 hrs per week
- [ ] Decrease Statistics time: 5 hrs → 4 hrs per week (on track)
- [ ] Earlier start on weekly problem sets (Sunday, not Thursday)

## Seek Help
- [ ] Schedule office hours with Chemistry professor (electron config confusion)
- [ ] Ask TA about practice problems for upcoming exam
- [ ] Consider peer tutoring for Chemistry
```

**Make it specific and measurable**:
- ❌ "Study more for Chemistry"
- ✓ "Increase Chemistry study time from 4 to 6 hours per week"

- ❌ "Get better at pretesting"
- ✓ "Set alarm 30 min before each class to complete pretest"

---

## Common Review Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "I skip weekly reviews (too busy)"

**Reframe**: Weekly review SAVES time (prevents wasted effort)

**Time math**:
- 60 min weekly review
- Prevents ~3-5 hours of wasted study time (wrong topics, ineffective methods)
- **Net savings: 2-4 hours per week**

**Solutions**:
1. **Schedule it**: Block Sunday 6-7 PM, non-negotiable
2. **Minimum viable**: Even 20-minute review > none
3. **Make it easy**: Use template (don't create from scratch each time)
4. **Accountability**: Tell friend/study partner you'll send them your review

### Challenge 2: "I don't know what to track"

**Start minimal**:
1. System adherence (did I do immediate reviews? Y/N)
2. Color distribution (% purple/blue/black)
3. One thing that worked, one thing that didn't

**That's it.** Three data points. Takes 10 minutes.

**Expand later** as you get comfortable with tracking.

### Challenge 3: "My data shows I'm failing but I don't know what to change"

**Seek help**:
- Academic advisor
- Professor office hours
- Peer tutoring services
- Study skills center
- Classmates who are succeeding

**Ask specific questions**:
- "I'm spending 6 hours/week on Chemistry but still getting C's. What should I change?"
- "My immediate reviews aren't leading to better retention. What am I doing wrong?"
- "I follow the system but my purple questions stay purple. What's missing?"

**Data shows WHAT is broken. Help shows HOW to fix it.**

### Challenge 4: "I feel overwhelmed by all the tracking"

**Simplify**:

**Minimum tracking**:
- Sunday review: 20 minutes
  - System adherence: [%]
  - Color changes: [Purple → Blue → Black]
  - One action item for next week

**That's it.**

**Everything else** is optional enhancement.

**Start small, add later** if you want more insight.

Week 1: [Purple/Blue/Black %]
Week 2: [Purple/Blue/Black %]
Week 3: [Purple/Blue/Black %]
Week 4: [Purple/Blue/Black %]

**Grades**:
[Trend over time]

**What I'm doing**:
[Describe typical study session]

Diagnose:
1. Why am I not seeing improvement?
2. What's the most likely bottleneck?
3. Is it system adherence, study method, time allocation, or something else?
4. Specific changes to make
```

#### Prompt 4: Help Me Prioritize Competing Demands

```
I'm overwhelmed. Help me prioritize.

**This week I have**:
- [X] lectures to attend
- [Y] assignments due
- [Z] exams coming up
- [Other commitments]

**Available time**: [X hours total for studying]

**Current grades / priorities**:
- [Course 1]: [Grade, target, gap]
- [Course 2]: [Grade, target, gap]
- [Course 3]: [Grade, target, gap]

**What's overwhelming me**:
[List specific stressors]

Help me:
1. Ruthlessly prioritize (what matters most)
2. Identify what I can let go (temporarily)
3. Allocate limited time effectively
4. Create realistic plan (not perfect, but manageable)
5. Reduce overwhelm while maintaining progress
```

### Decision Tree: "Do I Need to Adjust My Approach?"

```
START: Sunday weekly review completed. Do I need to adjust?

Check system adherence: Was it >80% this week?
├─ NO → FIX ADHERENCE FIRST
│  └─ Identify: Which step(s) am I skipping?
│     └─ Create: Specific plan to improve adherence
│        └─ Adjust next week, then reassess
│
└─ YES → Check learning progress: Is purple → blue → black happening?
   ├─ NO → ADJUST STUDY METHOD
   │  └─ Same purple questions for 2+ weeks?
   │     └─ Try: Different approach, seek help, more practice
   │
   └─ YES → Check grades: Am I on track for target grades?
      ├─ NO → ADJUST TIME ALLOCATION
      │  └─ Increase time on weak courses
      │     └─ Seek additional help (tutoring, office hours)
      │
      └─ YES → MAINTAIN CURRENT APPROACH
         └─ System is working
            └─ Minor optimizations only
               └─ Keep doing what you're doing

PRINCIPLE: Fix adherence before adjusting methods.
No method works if you don't follow it consistently.
```

## Final Implementation Guidance

### Start This Sunday

**Don't wait.** Do your first weekly review this coming Sunday.

**Even if**:
- You haven't been tracking all week (review what you remember)
- You don't have perfect data (estimate and start tracking going forward)
- You're mid-semester (better late than never)

**First review will be imperfect.** That's okay. Start the habit.

### The Compound Effect of Weekly Reviews

**Week 1**: Catch that you're skipping pretests
→ Fix it in Week 2

**Week 2**: Notice Chemistry not improving
→ Adjust method in Week 3

**Week 3**: See that morning study works better
→ Shift schedule in Week 4

**Week 4**: Realize you're on track for target grades
→ Maintain and optimize

**Without weekly review**: These insights come at exam time (too late)

**With weekly review**: Continuous improvement, early problem-catching

### This Becomes Automatic

**First few reviews**: Feel laborious, take 60+ minutes

**After 4-6 reviews**: Becomes routine, takes 30-40 minutes

**After semester**: Becomes automatic, you think in terms of weekly cycles

**Payoff**: Higher grades with less stress and wasted effort

---

**Remember**: You can't manage what you don't measure.

**Weekly review = measurement + management.**

**30-60 minutes per week to stay on track.**

**That's the weekly review system.**

**Do it this Sunday.**
