# During-Class Strategy: Active Question-Based Note-Taking

## Overview

Traditional note-taking is passive transcription. You write what the professor says, creating the illusion that you're learning when you're actually just recording. Question-based note-taking transforms lectures from passive reception to active engagement.

**Core Principle**: Questions force your brain to process information, identify gaps, and create retrieval cues. Answers can be looked up later; questions must be generated in real-time.

**Time**: Entire lecture (this replaces traditional note-taking)

**Goal**: 20-40 questions per 50-minute lecture (not notes)

---

## Why Traditional Note-Taking Fails

### The Transcription Trap

**What most students do**:
1. Professor talks
2. Student writes down what professor says
3. Student's brain is focused on writing, not understanding
4. Later, student has "notes" but no memory of lecture

**Result**: Illusion of productivity with minimal learning

### The Research

**Studies show**:
- Students who take verbatim notes perform WORSE on tests than students who take minimal notes
- Laptops encourage transcription → worse retention than handwriting
- More notes ≠ more learning (often inverse correlation)
- Retrieval practice during lectures > comprehensive notes after

**Why it fails**:
- Your brain is busy transcribing, not encoding
- No processing = no deep memory formation
- You feel productive but you're not learning
- "I'll study these notes later" rarely happens effectively

### The Question-Based Alternative

**Instead**:
1. Professor talks
2. Student generates questions about the content
3. Student's brain processes to formulate questions
4. Later, student answers questions (retrieval practice)

**Result**: Deep processing during lecture, effective study material after

---

## The Question-Based Note-Taking Protocol

### Core Rule: ONLY Write Questions

**What this means**:
- Every line you write must end with a question mark
- NO copying professor's words
- NO writing answers during lecture
- ONLY questions

**Why this works**:
- Forces active processing (can't generate question without understanding topic)
- Creates retrieval cues for later study
- Identifies knowledge gaps in real-time
- Prevents illusion of competence from copying

**Example comparison**:

**Traditional notes** (transcription):
```
Photosynthesis
- Process by which plants convert light to chemical energy
- Occurs in chloroplasts
- Light-dependent reactions: occur in thylakoid membrane
- Light-independent reactions: occur in stroma
- Products: glucose and oxygen
- Inputs: CO2 and water
```

**Question-based notes** (active):
```
Photosynthesis
- What is photosynthesis?
- Where in the cell does photosynthesis occur?
- What are the two main stages of photosynthesis?
- What happens in light-dependent reactions?
- Where do light-dependent reactions occur?
- What happens in light-independent reactions?
- Where do light-independent reactions occur?
- What are the products of photosynthesis?
- What are the inputs needed for photosynthesis?
- How do light-dependent and light-independent reactions connect?
```

**Notice**: Question-based notes create 10 retrieval opportunities. Traditional notes create 0.

## Step-by-Step: How to Take Question-Based Notes

### Step 1: Convert Slide Titles to Questions (Easiest)

**What to do**:
1. Professor shows slide with title
2. Convert title to question format
3. Write it down
4. Move on (don't write answer)

**Examples**:

| Slide Title | Question |
|------------|----------|
| "Use of Operational Amplifiers" | What is an operational amplifier? |
| "The French Revolution" | What was the French Revolution? |
| "Krebs Cycle" | What is the Krebs cycle? |
| "Supply and Demand Equilibrium" | What is supply and demand equilibrium? |
| "Mitosis vs. Meiosis" | What is the difference between mitosis and meiosis? |

**This is your baseline**: Every slide title = at least one question.

---

### Step 2: Use Question Prompts (Depth)

Go beyond simple "what is" questions using these prompts:

#### Prompt Type 1: Relationship Questions

**Stems**:
- "How does X relate to Y?"
- "What's the connection between X and Y?"
- "How does X affect Y?"

**When to use**: Professor mentions two concepts together

**Examples**:
- "How does temperature relate to enzyme activity?"
- "What's the connection between supply and demand?"
- "How does mitochondria relate to ATP production?"

#### Prompt Type 2: Example Questions

**Stems**:
- "What is an example of X?"
- "Can you provide a real-world application of X?"
- "What's a specific case of X?"

**When to use**: Professor explains abstract concept

**Examples**:
- "What is an example of natural selection?"
- "What's a real-world application of derivatives?"
- "What's a specific case of market failure?"

#### Prompt Type 3: Process Questions

**Stems**:
- "What are the steps in process X?"
- "How does X happen?"
- "What is the sequence of X?"

**When to use**: Professor describes any multi-step process

**Examples**:
- "What are the steps in the scientific method?"
- "How does protein synthesis happen?"
- "What is the sequence of events in an action potential?"

#### Prompt Type 4: Reason Questions

**Stems**:
- "Why does X happen?"
- "What causes X?"
- "What's the reason for X?"

**When to use**: Professor explains causation or mechanism

**Examples**:
- "Why does ice float on water?"
- "What causes inflation?"
- "What's the reason for cell differentiation?"

#### Prompt Type 5: Comparison Questions

**Stems**:
- "How is X different from Y?"
- "What do X and Y have in common?"
- "Compare and contrast X and Y"

**When to use**: Professor mentions two related concepts

**Examples**:
- "How is DNA different from RNA?"
- "What do classical and operant conditioning have in common?"
- "Compare and contrast socialism and capitalism"

#### Prompt Type 6: Application Questions

**Stems**:
- "How would you use X in scenario Y?"
- "What would happen if X?"
- "How can X solve problem Y?"

**When to use**: Professor discusses practical applications

**Examples**:
- "How would you use integration to find area under a curve?"
- "What would happen if there were no ozone layer?"
- "How can game theory solve negotiation problems?"

---

### Step 3: Mine Lecture Objectives (Free Questions)

**What to do**:
1. If professor lists lecture objectives at start, write them as questions
2. These are guaranteed exam-relevant questions
3. One objective = one or more questions

**Example**:

**Professor says**: "Today's objectives are to understand the structure of DNA, explain base pairing, and describe DNA replication"

**Your questions**:
```
- What is the structure of DNA?
- What is base pairing?
- How does base pairing work?
- What is DNA replication?
- What are the steps in DNA replication?
- How does DNA structure enable replication?
```

**This takes 30 seconds and gives you 6 questions.**

---

### Step 4: Convert Diagrams to Questions

**What to do**:
1. Professor shows diagram/graph/figure
2. Don't copy the diagram (waste of time)
3. Instead, write questions about it
4. Note diagram number for later reference

**Examples**:

**Professor shows Figure 5.3: Cell Membrane Structure**

**Your questions**:
```
- What are the main components of the cell membrane? (Fig 5.3)
- How are phospholipids arranged in the membrane? (Fig 5.3)
- What is the function of membrane proteins? (Fig 5.3)
- What does "fluid mosaic model" mean? (Fig 5.3)
```

**Later**: You'll look up Figure 5.3 when answering these questions

**Advanced technique**: If diagram is critical, take phone photo (2 seconds) then write questions about it

---

### Step 5: Flag Emphasis and Confusion

**What to do**:
1. Add markers to your questions for later prioritization

**Emphasis markers** (professor says "this is important"):
- ⭐ = Professor emphasized
- EXAM = Professor said "this will be on the exam"
- ⚠️ = Repeated multiple times

**Confusion markers** (you don't understand):
- ??? = Very confused
- ? = Somewhat confused
- ❗ = Contradicts what you thought

**Example**:
```
- What is entropy? ???
- How does entropy relate to the second law of thermodynamics? ?
- What's an example of entropy in everyday life?
- ⭐ How do you calculate change in entropy? EXAM
```

**Later**: Prioritize ⭐, EXAM, and ??? questions when studying

---

### Step 6: Include Prior Knowledge Questions

**What to do**:
1. When professor mentions previous topic, create connection question
2. This builds integrated knowledge

**Example**:

**Professor says**: "This is similar to what we learned about ionic bonding last week"

**Your question**:
```
- How is covalent bonding similar to ionic bonding?
- How is covalent bonding different from ionic bonding?
```

**Later**: Answering these creates connections between topics (elaborative encoding)

---

### Step 7: Speed Over Perfection

**Key principle**: MOVE QUICKLY, don't get stuck

**What this means**:
- Imperfect question > no question
- Don't spend time making questions "perfect"
- Don't worry about grammar or complete sentences
- If you miss something, move on

**Example of "good enough" questions**:
```
✓ "What's mitosis?"
✓ "Mitosis steps?"
✓ "Mitosis vs meiosis??"
✗ Taking 2 minutes to write: "What is the complete, detailed,
   step-by-step process of mitosis including all sub-phases?"
```

**Speed benchmark**: 1 question every 60-90 seconds = 20-30 questions per lecture

**Why speed matters**:
- Professor keeps talking (you'll miss content if you're perfecting questions)
- You can refine questions during immediate review
- Quantity of retrieval cues > quality of question wording

---

## During Lecture: Real-Time Execution

### First 5 Minutes of Lecture

**What typically happens**:
1. Professor outlines today's topic
2. Lists learning objectives
3. Connects to previous lecture

**What you do**:
1. Write down topic as a question: "What is [topic]?"
2. Convert each objective to a question
3. Write connection question: "How does this relate to [previous topic]?"

**Time**: 5 minutes → 5-8 questions already written

### Middle of Lecture (Main Content)

**What typically happens**:
1. Professor presents slides
2. Explains concepts
3. Shows diagrams/examples
4. Emphasizes key points

**What you do**:
1. Convert each slide title to question
2. Add depth questions using prompts (how, why, example, etc.)
3. Flag emphasized points (⭐)
4. Note confusion (???)
5. Keep writing, don't stop

**Strategy**: Aim for 2-3 questions per slide

**Example** (10 slides in 40 minutes = 20-30 questions)

### Last 5 Minutes of Lecture

**What typically happens**:
1. Professor summarizes
2. Answers student questions
3. Previews next lecture

**What you do**:
1. Write summary question: "What are the main points of today's lecture?"
2. If other students ask questions, write those questions down
3. Write preview question: "What will we learn about [next topic]?"

**Time**: 5 minutes → 3-5 more questions

---

## Handling Different Lecture Styles

### Fast-Talking Professors

**Challenge**: Hard to keep up with rapid information delivery

**Solutions**:
1. Use abbreviations for common terms
2. Write shorter questions (fragments OK)
3. Focus on slide titles only (skip depth questions if necessary)
4. Record lecture (audio) to fill gaps later
5. Pair up: compare questions with classmate after

**Minimum viable**: Even just converting slide titles = 20+ questions

### Story-Based Lecturers

**Challenge**: Lots of examples/stories, unclear what's important

**Solutions**:
1. For each story: "What concept does this story illustrate?"
2. For each example: "What is this an example of?"
3. Don't write the story details, write questions about the underlying principle

**Example**:

**Professor tells 5-minute story about Watson and Crick discovering DNA structure**

**Don't write**: [5 minutes of story details]
**Do write**:
```
- What did Watson and Crick discover?
- How did Watson and Crick discover DNA structure?
- What made their discovery significant?
- What was the key insight that led to the discovery?
```

### Math/Problem-Solving Lectures

**Challenge**: Professor works through problem on board

**Solutions**:
1. Don't copy the problem-solving steps
2. Instead, write questions about the process
3. Note problem number for reference

**Example**:

**Professor solves integral on board for 10 minutes**

**Don't write**: [All the algebraic steps]
**Do write**:
```
Problem 3.4:
- What method is used to solve this integral?
- Why did we choose u-substitution here?
- What's the general strategy for integrals like this?
- What are common mistakes on problems like this?
- When would we use a different method?
```

**Advanced**: Take photo of board, reference it when answering questions later

### Discussion-Based Seminars

**Challenge**: No structured content delivery, student-led discussion

**Solutions**:
1. Write questions about each point raised
2. For debates: "What are arguments for X?" "What are arguments against X?"
3. For interpretations: "How does [Student A] interpret this?" "How is that different from [Student B]?"
4. Your own questions: Write questions about what YOU wonder

**These become excellent essay prep questions**

### Lab/Demonstration Classes

**Challenge**: Watching demonstrations or doing experiments

**Solutions**:
1. Before demo: "What do I predict will happen?"
2. During demo: "What's happening and why?"
3. After demo: "How does this demonstrate principle X?"
4. For procedures: "What are the steps?" "Why do we do step X?"

**Example** (Chemistry lab: Titration):
```
- What is titration?
- What is the purpose of this titration?
- What are the steps in performing a titration?
- Why do we add indicator?
- How do we know when to stop adding titrant?
- What calculations do we perform after?
- What could go wrong in this procedure?
```

---

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "The professor doesn't use slides"

**Solutions**:
1. Listen for topic transitions ("Now let's talk about X")
2. Each transition = new question: "What is X?"
3. Listen for signal phrases:
   - "The key point is..." → Write that as a question
   - "For example..." → "What is an example of X?"
   - "This causes..." → "Why does X cause Y?"
4. Take questions from your pretest (you already know what to ask)

### Challenge 2: "I can't think of questions fast enough"

**Solutions**:
1. Start with easiest: Convert every heading/topic to "What is X?"
2. Template questions (memorize these):
   - "What is X?"
   - "How does X work?"
   - "Why does X matter?"
   - "What's an example of X?"
3. Build speed over time (first few lectures will be slower)
4. If stuck: Leave blank line, move on, come back during immediate review

### Challenge 3: "I'm worried I'm missing information"

**Reframe**:
- You're not here to record ALL information
- You're here to identify KEY information
- Questions capture concepts; details can be looked up

**Safety nets**:
1. Lecture slides usually posted (you can review later)
2. Textbook has the details
3. Your questions guide what to look up

**Remember**: Better to have 20 questions you can answer later than 5 pages of notes you never review

### Challenge 4: "What if I write the wrong question?"

**This doesn't matter**. Examples:

**Professor talks about photosynthesis, you write**: "What is chlorophyll?"
**But professor was actually explaining**: Light-dependent reactions

**This is FINE because**:
1. During immediate review, you'll realize and adjust
2. You were engaged enough to generate a question
3. "Wrong" questions still create processing
4. You can reformulate later

**Fix it during immediate review** (20 minutes after class)

### Challenge 5: "I zone out and miss parts of lecture"

**This actually happens LESS with question-based notes because**:
- Active questioning keeps you engaged
- You can't write questions if you're not paying attention
- Each question is a mini-attention check

**If you do zone out**:
1. Draw a line: "— missed section —"
2. Ask classmate later what was covered
3. Generate questions about that section from textbook

### Challenge 6: "Some slides have no clear question"

**Examples**:
- Agenda slides
- Image-only slides
- Quote slides

**Solutions**:
1. Agenda slide: "What are we covering today?" (one question, move on)
2. Image slide: "What does this image illustrate?" or "Why did professor show this?"
3. Quote slide: "What does this quote mean?" or "How does this quote relate to the topic?"

**Every slide has at least one question possible.**

---

## Advanced Question-Based Techniques

### Technique 1: Hierarchical Questions

**What**: Organize questions by main topic and sub-topics

**How**:
```
Main Topic: Cellular Respiration
  - What is cellular respiration?

  Sub-topic: Glycolysis
    - What is glycolysis?
    - What are the steps of glycolysis?
    - Where does glycolysis occur?

  Sub-topic: Krebs Cycle
    - What is the Krebs cycle?
    - How does glycolysis connect to Krebs cycle?
```

**Why**: Creates organized structure for review, shows relationships

### Technique 2: Bloom's Taxonomy Questions

**What**: Write questions at different cognitive levels

**How**:
- **Remember**: "What is X?"
- **Understand**: "How does X work?"
- **Apply**: "How would you use X in situation Y?"
- **Analyze**: "What are the components of X?"
- **Evaluate**: "What are strengths/weaknesses of X?"
- **Create**: "How would you design X?"

**Why**: Higher-level questions = deeper encoding

**Example** (Photosynthesis):
```
Remember: What is photosynthesis?
Understand: How does photosynthesis produce glucose?
Apply: How would photosynthesis change in low light?
Analyze: What are the dependencies between light/dark reactions?
Evaluate: Why is photosynthesis more efficient than artificial energy?
Create: How would you design an artificial photosynthesis system?
```

### Technique 3: Anticipatory Questions

**What**: Predict professor's next point as a question

**How**:
1. After professor explains X, predict they'll explain Y next
2. Write: "What is Y?" before they get to it
3. If correct: You're tracking well
4. If wrong: You learn about connection

**Example**:

**Professor explains DNA structure**
**You predict**: Next will be DNA replication
**You write**: "How does DNA replicate?" (before professor gets there)
**Result**: When professor explains replication, you already have question ready

**Why**: Prediction enhances encoding + shows you're understanding flow

### Technique 4: Meta-Questions

**What**: Questions about the learning itself

**How**:
- "Why is this important?"
- "How does this connect to course objectives?"
- "What should I focus on for the exam?"
- "What's the real-world application of this?"

**When**: When professor doesn't make relevance clear

**Example**:
```
Professor explains eigenvalues for 20 minutes
You write:
- What is an eigenvalue?
- How do you calculate eigenvalues?
- Why are eigenvalues important? [meta-question]
- What are real-world applications of eigenvalues? [meta-question]
```

**Why**: Connects abstract content to meaning and motivation

### Technique 5: Peer Questions

**What**: Questions you'd ask a study partner

**How**:
- "How would you explain X to someone who hasn't taken this course?"
- "What's a good analogy for X?"
- "What's the simplest way to think about X?"

**Why**: Primes you to teach the material later (ultimate test of understanding)

---

## Integration with Before/After Class Protocols

### How Pretesting Connects to Question-Based Notes

**Before class** (pretest):
- You attempted problems and got many wrong
- You identified gaps
- You created priority questions

**During class** (question-based notes):
- Use your priority questions from pretest
- Write additional questions as lecture progresses
- Flag when professor answers your pretest questions

**Example**:

**Pretest question**: "How does NADH create ATP?"
**During lecture**: Professor explains electron transport chain
**You write**:
```
⭐ How does NADH create ATP? [from pretest]
- What is the electron transport chain?
- How does electron transport chain use NADH?
- What are the steps in electron transport chain?
```

**Result**: Pretest primed you to generate better questions during lecture

### How Question-Based Notes Connect to Immediate Review

**During class**:
- You write 20-40 questions
- You don't write answers
- Some questions are incomplete or unclear

**Immediately after class** (review):
- Attempt to answer each question from memory
- Reformulate unclear questions
- Color code based on how well you can answer

**Example**:

**During class** (rushed question):
```
- mitosis phases??
```

**Immediately after class** (reformulated and answered):
```
- What are the phases of mitosis?
  [Attempt to answer from memory]
  [Color code: Blue = remembered most phases but not order]

[Reformulated for clarity]:
- What are the phases of mitosis in order?
- What happens in each phase?
```

**Result**: Questions from lecture become retrieval practice in review

## Measuring Question-Based Note Success

### Quantity Metrics

After each lecture, count:
- [ ] How many questions did I write? (Target: 20-40)
- [ ] How many slides/topics covered? (Ratio should be 2-3 questions per topic)
- [ ] Did I have gaps where I wrote no questions? (Red flag)

### Quality Metrics

After each lecture, assess:
- [ ] Do my questions go beyond "what is"? (Target: 50%+ deeper questions)
- [ ] Did I include emphasis markers (⭐, EXAM)? (Shows I tracked importance)
- [ ] Did I flag confusion (???)? (Shows honest engagement)
- [ ] Are questions answerable? (If too vague, reformulate during review)

### Engagement Metrics

Self-reflection:
- [ ] Did I feel more engaged than with traditional notes?
- [ ] Did I zone out less?
- [ ] Can I remember more from this lecture than usual?
- [ ] Do I feel like I understand what's important?

**Target**: "Yes" to 3+ = question-based notes working

### Learning Metrics (longer term)

After first exam:
- [ ] Did lectures with question-based notes yield better retention?
- [ ] Did question-based notes make studying easier?
- [ ] Did exam questions feel familiar (because you'd already created similar questions)?
- [ ] Did you spend less time studying topics with good questions?

**Target**: If yes to 3+, commit to question-based notes for all classes

│  └─ YES → Write relevant question + add ⭐ or EXAM marker
│
├─ Did professor mention previous topic?
│  └─ YES → "How does [new topic] relate to [previous topic]?"
│
├─ Are you confused?
│  └─ YES → Write question about source of confusion + add ???
│
└─ Unsure what question to write?
   └─ DEFAULT → Write: "What is [whatever professor just said]?"
      (Imperfect question > no question)
```

## Final Implementation Guidance

### The First Lecture Will Feel Strange

**What to expect**:
- Awkward: "I'm not writing any notes!"
- Anxiety: "I'm missing information!"
- Uncertainty: "Am I doing this right?"
- Slowness: "I can't think of questions fast enough!"

**This is completely normal**. By lecture 3-4, it becomes natural.

### Start Simple, Add Complexity

**Week 1**: Just convert slide titles to "What is X?" questions
- This alone will generate 15-20 questions per lecture
- Build the habit of writing questions, not answers

**Week 2**: Add one layer of depth per slide
- Slide title: "What is X?"
- Plus one: "How does X work?" or "Why does X matter?"

**Week 3**: Add variety of question types
- Use different prompts (examples, comparisons, processes)

**Week 4**: Add markers and hierarchy
- Flag emphasis (⭐), confusion (???), structure (sub-topics)

### Trust That Answers Come Later

**The hardest mental shift**:
- Traditional notes: Capture answers now
- Question-based notes: Capture questions now, answers later

**Reminder**:
- Lecture is for generating questions (engagement)
- Immediate review is for answering questions (retrieval)
- Answers can be found in textbook, slides, classmates
- Questions must be generated in real-time during lecture
- **Questions > Answers** for learning

### Compare After First Exam

**The proof**:
1. Take question-based notes for half your classes
2. Take traditional notes for other half
3. After first exam, compare:
   - Which material do you remember better?
   - Which material was easier to study?
   - Which material did you understand more deeply?
   - Which approach felt more efficient?

**Most students report**: Significant advantage for question-based notes

**Then**: Commit to question-based notes for all classes

### This Works Because

**During lecture**:
- You're processing (not transcribing) → deeper encoding
- You're identifying gaps (not copying) → metacognitive awareness
- You're engaged (not passive) → sustained attention

**After lecture**:
- You have retrieval cues (questions) not summaries (answers)
- You practice retrieval (answering) not recognition (reading)
- You have clear feedback (can/can't answer) not illusion of knowledge

**Result**: More learning during lecture, more effective studying after lecture

**Remember**: The goal of lecture is NOT to capture every detail. The goal is to engage your brain in processing information and identifying what's important.

Questions do that. Transcription doesn't.

Write questions. Answer them later. Learn deeply.

That's the during-class strategy.
