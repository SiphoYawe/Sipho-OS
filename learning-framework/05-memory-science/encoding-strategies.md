# Encoding Strategies: How to Get Information Into Long-Term Memory

## Overview

Encoding is the critical gateway to long-term memory. Not all studying produces encoding—much of what students call "studying" creates only fleeting familiarity. This guide presents evidence-based strategies for deep, durable encoding.

## Levels of Processing Theory

### The Fundamental Principle

**Core insight**: The depth of mental processing during encoding determines retention quality.

**Research foundation** (Craik & Lockhart, 1972):
- Memory is a byproduct of processing depth
- Deeper, more meaningful processing creates stronger memory traces
- Shallow processing yields weak, temporary traces

### The Three Levels

#### Level 1: Shallow Processing (Structural)

**Focus**: Physical characteristics, surface features

**Examples:**
- "Is this word in capital letters?"
- "What font is this printed in?"
- "How many syllables does this word have?"
- Highlighting text without thinking about meaning

**Retention**: Poor (~15% recall after delay)

**Student trap:**
- Copying notes verbatim
- Highlighting passively
- Rewriting notes without processing meaning
- Transcribing slides word-for-word

**Why it fails:**
- No semantic processing
- No connection to existing knowledge
- No meaningful distinction between items
- Creates illusion of work without encoding

#### Level 2: Moderate Processing (Phonological)

**Focus**: Sound-based characteristics

**Examples:**
- "Does this word rhyme with 'brain'?"
- "How is this term pronounced?"
- Reading aloud

**Retention**: Moderate (~30% recall after delay)

**Student application:**
- Reading material aloud
- Creating rhymes or songs
- Focusing on pronunciation of technical terms

**Why it's better than shallow:**
- Requires more processing
- Engages auditory systems
- But still doesn't engage meaning deeply

#### Level 3: Deep Processing (Semantic)

**Focus**: Meaning, significance, relationships

**Examples:**
- "How does this concept relate to evolution?"
- "Does this principle apply to my own experience?"
- "Why would this mechanism be advantageous?"
- "How is this similar to/different from X?"

**Retention**: Excellent (~70%+ recall after delay)

**Student application:**
- Explaining concepts in your own words
- Creating examples and applications
- Connecting to prior knowledge
- Analyzing implications and relationships

**Why it works:**
- Engages semantic memory networks
- Creates multiple retrieval pathways
- Integrates with existing knowledge schemas
- Produces distinctive, meaningful memory traces

### Practical Implementation

**Transform shallow activities into deep processing:**

| Shallow Activity | Deep Processing Alternative |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Re-reading textbook | Generate questions and answer them |
| Highlighting passively | Summarize each section in own words |
| Copying notes | Create concept maps showing relationships |
| Reviewing flashcards | Explain why the answer is correct |
| Watching lecture again | Teach the material to someone else |

## Strategies for Deep Encoding

### 1. Elaboration: Connecting to Existing Knowledge

**What it is:**
Expanding on new information by relating it to what you already know.

**Why it works:**
- Creates multiple retrieval pathways
- Integrates new information into existing schemas
- Makes material more meaningful and distinctive
- Activates related neural networks

**How to practice:**

1. **Ask elaborative questions:**
   - "How is this similar to concepts I already know?"
   - "How is this different from related ideas?"
   - "Why does this make sense given what I know?"
   - "What would happen if this weren't true?"

2. **Generate connections:**
   - Link to prior courses: "This is like X from biology"
   - Link to real-world: "This explains why Y happens"
   - Link to other topics: "This contradicts/supports Z theory"

3. **Create explanatory frameworks:**
   - "This concept exists because..."
   - "This principle leads to..."
   - "This makes sense in the context of..."

**Example application:**

**Instead of**: "Mitochondria produce ATP through cellular respiration"

**Elaborate**: "Mitochondria produce ATP through cellular respiration, which is why cells with high energy demands (like muscle cells) have more mitochondria. This is similar to factories needing more power plants. This also explains why mitochondrial diseases affect muscles and nerves most severely—these tissues need the most energy. The process is similar to the energy extraction we learned about in chemistry when discussing oxidation-reduction reactions."

**Result**: Single fact becomes integrated network of understanding with multiple retrieval cues.

### 2. Organization: Structuring Information Logically

**What it is:**
Imposing meaningful structure on material to be learned.

**Why it works:**
- Reduces cognitive load through chunking
- Creates hierarchical retrieval pathways
- Reveals relationships between concepts
- Matches how long-term memory naturally organizes information

**Organizational structures:**

1. **Hierarchical outlines:**
   ```
   Main concept
   ├── Sub-concept A
   │   ├── Detail 1
   │   └── Detail 2
   └── Sub-concept B
       ├── Detail 1
       └── Detail 2
   ```

2. **Category groupings:**
   - Group related items together
   - Identify superordinate categories
   - Find subordinate examples

3. **Sequential/causal chains:**
   - Linear processes: Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3
   - Causal relationships: Cause → Effect → Consequence

4. **Matrix organizations:**
   - Compare/contrast tables
   - Feature matrices (items × characteristics)

**How to practice:**

1. **Before reading:**
   - Preview headings and subheadings
   - Identify the organizational structure
   - Predict how topics relate

2. **During learning:**
   - Create your own outlines
   - Build concept maps
   - Identify main ideas and supporting details

3. **After learning:**
   - Reorganize material in different ways
   - Create summary structures
   - Test if you can reproduce the organization from memory

**Example:**

**Unorganized**: "Neurons have dendrites, axons, myelin, nodes of Ranvier, synapses, neurotransmitters, action potentials..."

**Organized**:
```
Neuron Structure & Function
│
├── INPUT (Receiving signals)
│   ├── Dendrites: receive neurotransmitters
│   └── Cell body: integrates signals
│
├── TRANSMISSION (Sending signals)
│   ├── Axon: conducts action potential
│   ├── Myelin: insulates for faster conduction
│   └── Nodes of Ranvier: gaps for signal regeneration
│
└── OUTPUT (Passing to next neuron)
    ├── Synapse: junction between neurons
    └── Neurotransmitters: chemical messengers
```

### 3. Dual Coding: Verbal + Visual Representations

**What it is:**
Encoding information in both verbal and visual formats.

**Why it works:**
- Engages two separate memory systems
- Creates redundant pathways for retrieval
- Different formats suit different types of information
- Supports both verbal thinkers and visual thinkers

**Research foundation** (Paivio, 1971):
- Verbal system: processes language-based information
- Visual system: processes imagery and spatial information
- Items encoded in both systems are better remembered

**How to practice:**

1. **Convert text to visuals:**
   - Concepts → diagrams
   - Processes → flowcharts
   - Relationships → concept maps
   - Data → graphs and charts
   - Structures → labeled drawings

2. **Convert visuals to verbal:**
   - Explain diagrams in words
   - Write captions for images
   - Describe visual relationships
   - Verbalize processes shown visually

3. **Create integrated representations:**
   - Annotated diagrams
   - Mind maps with images and text
   - Infographics combining both modes

**Types of visual representations:**

- **Diagrams**: Show structure and components
- **Flowcharts**: Show processes and sequences
- **Concept maps**: Show relationships and connections
- **Graphs**: Show quantitative relationships
- **Timelines**: Show temporal sequences
- **Spatial maps**: Show physical or conceptual space

**Example:**

**Topic**: Cell membrane transport

**Verbal only**: "Passive transport moves molecules down their concentration gradient without energy. Active transport moves molecules against their gradient using ATP."

**Dual coding**: [Student draws diagram showing:]
- Cell membrane with channels
- Arrows showing passive transport (down gradient, no ATP)
- Arrows showing active transport (up gradient, with ATP symbol)
- Concentration gradients indicated by dots

**Result**: Can retrieve concept through either verbal explanation or visual reconstruction.

### 4. Self-Reference: Relating to Personal Experience

**What it is:**
Connecting new information to yourself, your experiences, or your goals.

**Why it works:**
- Self-referential information is privileged in memory
- Personal relevance increases processing depth
- Emotional connection enhances encoding
- Creates unique, distinctive memory traces

**Research evidence:**
- Items rated for self-relevance are remembered better than items processed for other semantic qualities
- Effect is robust and large (~50% improvement)

**How to practice:**

1. **Ask self-referential questions:**
   - "How does this apply to my life?"
   - "When have I experienced something related?"
   - "Why does this matter to me?"
   - "How could I use this?"

2. **Create personal examples:**
   - Apply concepts to your own situations
   - Use your own experiences as case studies
   - Connect to your goals and interests

3. **Make personal judgments:**
   - "Do I agree with this?"
   - "How does this change my thinking?"
   - "What does this mean for my beliefs?"

**Example:**

**Topic**: Confirmation bias

**Generic encoding**: "Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek information that confirms existing beliefs."

**Self-referenced encoding**: "Confirmation bias explains why I only followed news sources that agreed with my political views during the last election. I actively avoided information that challenged my position, which prevented me from considering other perspectives. I can see this in how I approach scientific topics too—I need to actively seek out contradictory evidence when researching."

**Result**: Personal connection makes concept memorable and applicable.

### 5. Generation: Creating Your Own Examples

**What it is:**
Producing information yourself rather than passively receiving it.

**Why it works:**
- Active generation requires deeper processing than passive review
- Creates transfer-appropriate processing
- Reveals gaps in understanding
- Builds confidence and metacognitive accuracy

**The generation effect** (Slamecka & Graf, 1978):
- Self-generated information is better remembered than read information
- Effect holds for words, sentences, concepts, problems

**How to practice:**

1. **Generate examples:**
   - After learning a concept, create your own examples
   - Don't rely only on textbook examples
   - Create multiple, varied examples
   - Share examples with study partners

2. **Generate explanations:**
   - Explain concepts in your own words
   - Don't just paraphrase the textbook
   - Pretend you're teaching someone else
   - Write explanations without looking at source

3. **Generate questions:**
   - Create your own practice questions
   - Predict exam questions
   - Develop "why" and "how" questions
   - Exchange questions with classmates

4. **Generate applications:**
   - Think of real-world applications
   - Create hypothetical scenarios
   - Solve novel problems using the concept

5. **Generate connections:**
   - Identify relationships between topics
   - Create analogies
   - Find contradictions or tensions

**Example:**

**Topic**: Natural selection

**Passive**: Read Darwin's finch example in textbook

**Generative**:
- "I'll create my own example: Urban pigeons have evolved to have different foot structures because some cities have narrow ledges on buildings, selecting for pigeons with gripping feet. Over generations, city pigeons look different from rural ones."
- "Another example: Antibiotic-resistant bacteria evolve because antibiotics kill susceptible bacteria, leaving resistant ones to reproduce."
- "Wait, this also explains why we have different dog breeds—humans artificially selected for traits, which is like natural selection but the environment is human preference."

**Result**: Deep understanding demonstrated through successful generation, plus multiple retrieval cues.

## The Picture Superiority Effect

**The phenomenon:**
Images are remembered better than words.

**Research findings:**
- Recognition memory: ~90% for pictures vs. ~50% for words (after 3 days)
- Effect is robust across ages and cultures
- Particularly strong for concrete, distinctive images

**Why it works:**
- Images are automatically processed semantically
- Images engage dual coding (visual + verbal labeling)
- Images are often more distinctive than words
- Images are processed more holistically

**Student application:**

1. **Seek out visual representations:**
   - Use textbooks with good illustrations
   - Watch educational videos with animations
   - Find online visualizations and simulations

2. **Create your own visuals:**
   - Draw diagrams, even rough ones
   - Sketch processes and structures
   - Create visual mnemonics
   - Use colors and spatial organization

3. **Mentally visualize:**
   - Create mental images of concepts
   - Visualize processes in motion
   - Imagine yourself in scenarios
   - Use method of loci (memory palace)

**Important caveat:**
- Complex diagrams can overload working memory
- Start simple, add detail gradually
- Explain visuals to yourself to ensure processing

## Chunking: Grouping Related Items

**What it is:**
Organizing individual items into meaningful groups to overcome working memory limitations.

**Why it works:**
- Each chunk counts as one item in working memory
- Dramatically increases effective capacity
- Reflects and builds expertise
- Creates organizational structure for retrieval

**How experts chunk:**
- Chess masters see board patterns, not individual pieces
- Musicians see phrases, not individual notes
- Programmers see algorithms, not individual lines
- Medical students see disease patterns, not isolated symptoms

**How to develop chunking:**

1. **Identify natural groupings:**
   - Category membership (all are types of X)
   - Functional relationships (all serve function Y)
   - Temporal sequences (steps in process Z)
   - Spatial proximity (all located in region A)

2. **Create meaningful acronyms/mnemonics:**
   - ROYGBIV for rainbow colors
   - HOMES for Great Lakes
   - Every Good Boy Does Fine for musical notes
   - **Important**: Mnemonic must be meaningful, not arbitrary

3. **Build hierarchical structures:**
   - Super-categories containing sub-categories
   - Main concepts with supporting details
   - Principles with examples

4. **Develop expertise:**
   - As you learn more, natural chunks emerge
   - Patterns become recognizable
   - Complex structures become single units

**Example progression:**

**Novice**: Sees 12 separate facts about the heart
- Four chambers
- Two atria
- Two ventricles
- Right side pumps to lungs
- Left side pumps to body
- Etc.

**Intermediate**: Chunks into systems
- Chambers (4: 2 atria + 2 ventricles)
- Circulation (2 loops: pulmonary + systemic)
- Valves (4: prevent backflow)

**Expert**: Chunks into integrated function
- Dual-pump system (right → lungs, left → body)
- One-way flow system (valves → chambers → circulation)
- Pressure gradient system (high → low pressure pathways)

## Why Passive Re-reading is Shallow Encoding

### The Fluency Illusion

**The problem:**
- Re-reading makes material feel familiar
- Fluency is mistaken for mastery
- Students confuse recognition with recall

**What actually happens:**
1. First reading: Material is effortful, processed
2. Second reading: Material is familiar, less effort
3. Third reading: Material feels fluent, minimal processing

**The mistake:**
- Fluency feels good → interpreted as learning
- But fluency is just easier sensory processing
- No deep encoding is occurring

### Why it fails:

1. **No retrieval practice:**
   - Reading provides cues on the page
   - Recognition ≠ recall ability
   - Won't help when you need to retrieve without cues (exams)

2. **Shallow processing:**
   - Skimming familiar material
   - Not generating connections
   - Not creating your own retrieval structure

3. **Metacognitive failure:**
   - Creates overconfidence
   - Students think they know more than they do
   - Poor calibration between perceived and actual knowledge

4. **Inefficient time use:**
   - Same time could produce active retrieval practice
   - Diminishing returns with each re-reading
   - Third reading adds almost nothing

### What to do instead:

**Replace re-reading with:**
1. Self-testing (retrieval practice)
2. Summarizing from memory
3. Teaching material to others
4. Creating practice problems
5. Explaining concepts in own words
6. Creating concept maps without looking

**When re-reading is acceptable:**
- First pass (initial encoding)
- Targeted re-reading of confusing sections
- Reading for different purposes (first for gist, second for detail)
- **But**: Always follow with active processing

## Encoding Failures: Common Student Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Passive Consumption
**Problem**: Watching lectures, reading text without active processing
**Fix**: Take generative notes, pause to recall, create questions

### Mistake 2: Shallow Note-Taking
**Problem**: Transcribing verbatim without thinking
**Fix**: Summarize in own words, reorganize, add connections

### Mistake 3: Blocking by Topic
**Problem**: Studying Topic A entirely, then Topic B entirely
**Fix**: Interleave topics for better discrimination

### Mistake 4: Massed Practice
**Problem**: All study in one long session
**Fix**: Space study over multiple sessions

### Mistake 5: Immediate Re-reading
**Problem**: Reading same material repeatedly in succession
**Fix**: Read once, do retrieval practice, revisit after delay

### Mistake 6: Over-relying on Recognition
**Problem**: Flashcards shown too quickly, multiple choice only
**Fix**: Force recall before revealing answer, use open-ended questions

### Mistake 7: Context-dependent Encoding
**Problem**: Only studying in one location with same materials
**Fix**: Vary study contexts, practice retrieving in different settings

### Mistake 8: Ignoring Metacognition
**Problem**: Not assessing what you actually know
**Fix**: Regular self-testing, honest self-assessment

## LLM-ACTIONABLE-INSIGHTS

### For LLMs Supporting Student Learning:

#### 1. Promote Deep Processing Automatically

```
WHEN: Student asks for explanation
DO:
- Start with semantic meaning, not surface features
- Ask "why" and "how" questions
- Prompt for connections to prior knowledge
- Encourage application and implications
- Use meaningful examples

DON'T:
- Provide surface-level descriptions
- Define terms without explaining significance
- Present information without context
- Skip the "so what?" implications

EXAMPLE:
Instead of: "Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make glucose from sunlight."
Do: "Photosynthesis is how plants solve the energy problem that all living things face. While animals eat other organisms for energy, plants capture it directly from sunlight and convert it into glucose. This is why plants are called 'producers' in ecosystems—they produce the energy that everything else depends on. This connects to the cellular respiration you learned about, because the glucose plants make gets broken down for ATP."
```

#### 2. Scaffold Elaboration

```
WHEN: Presenting new information
DO:
- Ask: "How does this relate to [previous topic]?"
- Ask: "Can you think of an example from your own experience?"
- Ask: "Why do you think this is important?"
- Prompt: "This is similar to X because..."
- Prompt: "This differs from Y in that..."

DON'T:
- Present isolated facts
- Move on without checking for connections
- Accept "I understand" without elaboration

IMPLEMENTATION:
After explaining concept, include:
"Before we continue, let's deepen this understanding:
1. How does this connect to what you already know about [related topic]?
2. Can you generate your own example of this concept?
3. Why do you think this principle exists/matters?"
```

#### 3. Encourage Generation Over Passive Receipt

```
WHEN: Teaching concepts
DO:
- Ask student to generate examples before providing yours
- Prompt for explanations in their own words
- Request predictions before revealing answers
- Ask for applications to novel scenarios
- Have student create questions

DON'T:
- Immediately provide all information
- Give examples without student attempting first
- Reveal answers before student attempts generation

PATTERN:
1. Present concept
2. "Before I give you examples, can you try to create one?"
3. Student attempts
4. Provide feedback + additional examples
5. "Now try creating a different type of example..."
```

#### 4. Facilitate Organization

```
WHEN: Teaching multi-component topics
DO:
- Present organizational framework first
- Use hierarchical structure in explanations
- Create visual outlines or concept maps
- Explicitly state relationships between topics
- Summarize structure at end

DON'T:
- Present unstructured information
- Mix levels of abstraction randomly
- Assume student will organize on their own

TEMPLATE:
"Let's organize our understanding of [topic]:

Big Picture: [Main concept/purpose]

Key Components:
1. [Component A]
   - [Detail 1]
   - [Detail 2]
2. [Component B]
   - [Detail 1]
   - [Detail 2]

Relationships:
- A → B because...
- A differs from B in...

Now, can you recreate this organization from memory?"
```

#### 5. Implement Dual Coding Prompts

```
WHEN: Explaining visual or spatial concepts
DO:
- Encourage student to draw diagrams
- Describe visual representations verbally
- Ask: "Can you sketch this concept?"
- Provide both text and image descriptions
- Prompt for conversion: text → visual or visual → text

DON'T:
- Rely solely on verbal explanations
- Skip visual representations for complex topics
- Assume student will visualize without prompting

EXAMPLES:
- "Try drawing a simple diagram showing how these components relate."
- "Can you describe this process as if you were watching it happen?"
- "Sketch a flowchart of this decision process."
- "Visualize this in your mind, then describe what you see."
```

#### 6. Leverage Self-Reference

```
WHEN: Teaching abstract or unmotivating content
DO:
- Ask: "How does this apply to your life/goals?"
- Prompt: "When have you experienced something related?"
- Connect to student's interests or major
- Use student's previous examples and references
- Personalize applications

DON'T:
- Keep all examples generic
- Ignore student's context and interests
- Use only textbook examples

PERSONALIZATION:
"You mentioned you're interested in [X]. This concept applies to that because...
Can you think of how you might use this principle in [X context]?"
```

#### 7. Prevent Passive Re-reading

```
WHEN: Student says "I'll read this again"
DO:
- Redirect to retrieval practice
- Suggest: "Instead of re-reading, can you summarize from memory?"
- Propose: "Try explaining this without looking first"
- Encourage: "Create practice questions instead"
- Warn about fluency illusion

DON'T:
- Encourage passive re-reading
- Suggest reviewing without active processing
- Let student mistake familiarity for learning

INTERVENTION:
"Re-reading often feels productive but doesn't encode well. Let's try something more effective:
1. Put the material away
2. Write down everything you remember
3. Then check what you missed
4. Focus on gaps in next review
This will give you much stronger encoding than re-reading."
```

#### 8. Assess Encoding Depth

```
WHEN: Checking student understanding
DO:
- Ask for explanations, not definitions
- Request examples and applications
- Probe for connections and implications
- Check for transfer to new contexts
- Distinguish recognition from recall

DON'T:
- Accept verbatim textbook language
- Use only recognition questions
- Skip application questions
- Assume understanding from correct definitions

DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS:
Surface: "What is X?" → Tests recognition/memorization
Deep: "Why is X important?" → Tests semantic understanding
Deeper: "How would you use X to solve Y?" → Tests application
Deepest: "How does X relate to Z?" → Tests integration
```

#### 9. Optimize Chunking Support

```
WHEN: Presenting complex information
DO:
- Identify natural chunks and label them
- Create hierarchical groupings
- Use categorical organization
- Provide memory aids for chunks
- Build from simple to complex chunks

DON'T:
- Present too many ungrouped items
- Exceed working memory limits (4-7 chunks)
- Create arbitrary groupings

STRUCTURE:
"This topic has 12 components, which is too many to hold in mind.
Let's chunk them into 3 categories of 4 items each:

Category 1: [Name] - includes A, B, C, D
Category 2: [Name] - includes E, F, G, H
Category 3: [Name] - includes I, J, K, L

Now we're thinking about 3 chunks instead of 12 items.
Can you recall the three category names?"
```

#### 10. Create Encoding-Optimized Explanations

```
COMPLETE PATTERN:

1. ACTIVATE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
"Before we start, what do you already know about [topic]?"

2. PROVIDE FRAMEWORK
"Here's the big picture: [framework/organization]"

3. PRESENT IN CHUNKS
"Let's focus on the first part: [3-4 key points]"

4. PROMPT DEEP PROCESSING
"How does this relate to [previous topic]?"
"Can you create an example?"

5. ENCOURAGE DUAL CODING
"Try drawing a simple diagram of this."

6. FACILITATE SELF-REFERENCE
"How might this apply to your [context]?"

7. PRACTICE RETRIEVAL
"Before we continue, can you explain back to me...?"

8. CHECK ENCODING DEPTH
"Why is this concept important?"
"How would you use this?"

9. SUMMARIZE ORGANIZATION
"Let's review the structure of what we've covered."

10. ASSIGN GENERATIVE TASK
"Create your own example/question/application."
```

### Sample Dialogue Showing Encoding Optimization:

**POOR ENCODING SUPPORT:**
```
Student: "Explain classical conditioning."
LLM: "Classical conditioning is when a neutral stimulus becomes associated
with a meaningful stimulus through repeated pairing, eventually eliciting
the same response. Pavlov's dogs heard a bell before food, then the bell
alone made them salivate. Understand?"
Student: "Yes."
[Shallow encoding: recognition only, no deep processing]
```

**OPTIMIZED ENCODING SUPPORT:**
```
Student: "Explain classical conditioning."

LLM: "Before I explain, what do you already know about learning or how
associations form?"

Student: "Like when you learn to associate things together?"

LLM: "Exactly—let's build on that. Classical conditioning is one specific
way associations form. Here's the framework:

1. Start: Neutral stimulus (no reaction)
2. Pairing: Neutral stimulus + Meaningful stimulus
3. Result: Neutral stimulus → Conditioned response

Let's use Pavlov's famous example:
1. Bell (neutral - dogs ignore it)
2. Bell + Food (dogs salivate to food)
3. Bell alone → Salivation

Now, before I continue—can you think of an example from your own life
where you've formed an association like this?"

Student: "Like when I hear my alarm clock, I feel anxious even on weekends?"

LLM: "Perfect example! Let's analyze it with the conditioning framework:
1. Alarm sound (originally neutral)
2. Alarm + Waking up for stressful school days (paired repeatedly)
3. Alarm alone → Anxiety

This is why your example shows classical conditioning. The alarm (neutral)
became associated with stress, so now triggers anxiety automatically.

Try drawing a simple diagram showing: Alarm + School → Anxiety, then
Alarm alone → Anxiety

[Student draws]

Great! Now the key question: Why does this matter? Why is classical
conditioning important to understand?

[Student explains]

Excellent. Now here's your generative task: Create a different example of
classical conditioning, but from an animal behavior or therapy context.
Don't use the alarm or dogs example—create your own."

[Deep encoding: retrieval, generation, self-reference, dual coding,
semantic processing]
```

---

**Key Takeaway**: Encoding quality, not study time, predicts retention. Use deep, elaborative, organizational, generative strategies consistently. Avoid passive re-reading and shallow processing that creates illusions of learning.
