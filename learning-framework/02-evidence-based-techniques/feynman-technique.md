# The Feynman Technique: Teaching to Learn

## Richard Feynman's Learning Philosophy

**Richard Feynman** (1918-1988) was a Nobel Prize-winning physicist known for his ability to explain complex concepts in simple, intuitive terms.

**His core belief:**
> "If you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it."

**The Feynman principle:** True understanding means you can teach the concept to someone with no background in the subject - a child, your grandmother, someone from a completely different field.

**Why this matters:**
- Most students THINK they understand when they can recognize concepts
- True understanding = ability to generate explanations from scratch
- Teaching forces you to confront gaps you didn't know existed

**Feynman's own words:**
> "I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something."

You can memorize "mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell" without understanding anything about cellular respiration, ATP production, or why cells need energy in the first place.

**The Feynman Technique forces you to move from knowing names to knowing things.**

## The 4-Step Process

### Step 1: Choose a Concept to Learn

**What to choose:**
- A single concept (not an entire chapter)
- Something specific enough to explain in 5-10 minutes
- Something you THINK you understand but want to deepen

**Good choices:**
- "Opportunity cost" (economics)
- "Natural selection" (biology)
- "Quadratic formula" (math)
- "The water cycle" (environmental science)
- "Supply and demand" (economics)

**Too broad (avoid):**
- "All of calculus"
- "World War II"
- "Cell biology"
- "Economics"

**How to identify good concepts:**
- Topics your professor emphasized
- Concepts that connect to many other ideas
- Things you got wrong on practice tests
- Topics you can KIND OF explain but not perfectly

**Write the concept name at the top of a blank sheet of paper.**

### Step 2: Teach It to a Child (Use Simple Language)

**The challenge:** Explain the concept as if teaching a 5th grader (age 10-11).

**Rules:**
1. **No jargon** - If you use a technical term, immediately define it in simple words
2. **Use analogies** - Compare to everyday things the child knows
3. **Use examples** - Concrete instances, not abstract definitions
4. **Short sentences** - Complexity of thought ≠ complexity of language
5. **Check understanding** - Would a 10-year-old actually get this?

**Example: Bad (jargon-filled) explanation of photosynthesis:**

"Photosynthesis is the process by which autotrophic organisms utilize electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum to catalyze the endergonic conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and molecular oxygen via light-dependent and light-independent reactions in the chloroplast."

**A 5th grader's response:** "...What?"

**Good (Feynman-style) explanation:**

"Plants make their own food, which is pretty cool. Here's how:

Imagine you're hungry but there's no food around. What if you could make food from air, water, and sunshine? That's what plants do!

Plants take in:
- Air (specifically a gas called carbon dioxide - the stuff we breathe OUT)
- Water (from the ground through their roots)
- Sunshine (light energy)

Then inside special parts of their leaves (called chloroplasts - think of them as tiny kitchens), they use the sunshine's energy to combine the air and water and make:
- Sugar (their food - specifically glucose, which is like plant candy)
- Oxygen (the gas we need to breathe - plants make our AIR!)

So basically: Plants eat sunshine and air, and poop out oxygen for us. We eat oxygen (by breathing), and breathe out carbon dioxide for plants. It's a perfect trade!

This is why we need plants. They're not just decorations - they're oxygen factories and the foundation of almost all food on Earth."

**Notice in the good explanation:**
- Used analogy (plants as oxygen factories, chloroplasts as kitchens)
- Defined technical terms immediately (carbon dioxide = "the stuff we breathe out")
- Connected to what the child knows (breathing, eating, trading)
- Used simple cause-and-effect structure
- Added significance ("why this matters")

### Step 3: Identify Gaps When You Get Stuck

**This is where the learning actually happens.**

**As you try to explain simply, you'll hit walls:**

**Wall #1: "I can't think of a simple way to say this"**
→ You don't understand it deeply enough yet

**Wall #2: "I'm not sure why this works"**
→ You know WHAT but not WHY

**Wall #3: "I can't think of an example"**
→ You have abstract knowledge but can't apply it

**Wall #4: "I'm using jargon because the simple version sounds wrong"**
→ You've memorized terminology but not meaning

**What to do when you hit a wall:**

1. **Mark it clearly**
   ```
   Write in your explanation: [GAP: Not sure why chlorophyll is green]
   or
   [STUCK: Can't explain why electrons move in circuit]
   ```

2. **Don't skip over it**
   - It's tempting to write "...and then photosynthesis happens..." and move on
   - That's the exact gap you need to fill!

3. **Note what specifically you don't understand**
   ```
   Not: "I don't get photosynthesis"
   Instead: "I don't understand why the light-dependent reactions produce ATP and NADPH specifically, or what those molecules do in the Calvin cycle"
   ```

4. **Collect all gaps before moving to Step 4**

**Example in action:**

```
Student explaining DNA replication:

"DNA is like a twisted ladder. When a cell needs to copy its DNA, it...
[STUCK - how does it unzip? What enzyme?]

...unzips the ladder. Then...
[STUCK - which direction does copying go? Why only one direction?]

...it copies each side by adding matching letters (A matches with T, G matches with C).
[GOOD - I can explain base pairing]

The result is two identical DNA molecules.
[STUCK - Are they really IDENTICAL? What about mutations? Proofreading?]"

GAPS IDENTIFIED:
1. What enzyme unzips DNA?
2. Why does DNA copy in only one direction?
3. What's the proofreading mechanism?
```

**These gaps are gifts.** They tell you exactly what to study next.

### Step 4: Return to Source Material, Then Simplify Again

**For each gap identified in Step 3:**

1. **Go back to your textbook/notes/lecture**
   - Find the section covering that specific gap
   - Read with focus on answering your specific question
   - Not re-reading everything - targeted learning

2. **Learn the concept properly**
   - Understand the mechanism
   - Find or create examples
   - Look up analogies if needed
   - Watch a video if text isn't clicking

3. **Return to your explanation and fill the gap**
   - Write the simple explanation of what you just learned
   - Stay in "teaching to a child" mode
   - Don't copy textbook language

4. **Read the full explanation aloud**
   - Does it flow naturally?
   - Would someone actually understand this?
   - Any remaining gaps?

**Example - Filling the gaps from above:**

```
After research, student rewrites:

"DNA is like a twisted ladder (double helix). When a cell needs to copy its DNA,
an enzyme called helicase (think of it like a zipper) unzips the ladder down
the middle, breaking the rungs apart.

Now you have two separate strands, each one a template (like a pattern).

Another enzyme called DNA polymerase reads each template and builds a matching
new strand by adding complementary letters:
- Where it sees A, it adds T
- Where it sees T, it adds A
- Where it sees G, it adds C
- Where it sees C, it adds G

Here's the tricky part: DNA polymerase can only read in one direction (like
reading a book left to right, not right to left). So one strand gets copied
smoothly in one continuous piece (called the leading strand - it's the easy one).

The other strand has to be copied in chunks going backwards (called the lagging
strand - like reading a book backwards one page at a time). Another enzyme
called DNA ligase glues these chunks together.

The result is two complete DNA molecules. Each one has one old strand (from the
original) and one new strand (just built). This is called semi-conservative
replication.

There's even a proofreading system! DNA polymerase checks its work and fixes
mistakes - like spell-check for DNA. This is why mutations are rare."

NO MORE GAPS. Full understanding.
```

**Iterate as needed:** You might need to go through Steps 2-4 multiple times before your explanation is gap-free and truly simple.

## Why Teaching Reveals Knowledge Gaps

**The explanation paradox:** You can feel like you understand something perfectly when reading it. But when you try to EXPLAIN it, you realize you don't.

**Why teaching is a stricter test than reading:**

### Reading (Passive):
- Your brain recognizes ideas: "Yes, I've seen this before"
- Gaps are hidden: "That makes sense" (but you couldn't generate it yourself)
- Feels easy: "I totally get this"
- Illusion of competence

### Teaching (Active):
- Your brain must generate ideas: "How do I explain this from scratch?"
- Gaps are exposed: "Wait, why does that happen?"
- Feels hard: "I thought I understood this..."
- True test of competence

**The Feynman insight:** The person who can teach is the person who truly knows.

**Psychological mechanism - The illusion of explanatory depth:**

Research shows people consistently overestimate their understanding of how things work. We think we know how a zipper works, how a bicycle stays upright, how a toilet flushes - until we try to explain it in detail.

**The Feynman Technique shatters this illusion.**

When you try to teach:
- You can't skip steps (student needs every step)
- You can't use jargon (student doesn't know it)
- You can't be vague (student will ask "why?")
- You can't fake it (either you can explain or you can't)

**Result:** Teaching is a ruthlessly honest assessment of your understanding.

## Variations on the Technique

### Variation 1: Rubber Duck Debugging

**Origin:** Programming technique where developers explain their code to a rubber duck.

**How it works:**
1. Get a rubber duck (or any inanimate object)
2. Place it on your desk
3. Explain the concept to the duck out loud
4. When you get stuck explaining, you've found a gap

**Why a duck (not a person):**
- No judgment (can't feel embarrassed)
- Won't interrupt or answer for you (forces YOU to work through it)
- Always available (even at 2am)
- Won't get bored (you can take as long as you need)

**When to use:**
- When you're struggling with a concept alone
- When no study partner is available
- When you want to practice explaining before teaching a real person
- For debugging your own understanding (like programmers debug code)

**Bonus:** Actually speaking out loud (vs just thinking) forces complete thoughts and reveals verbal stumbling blocks.

### Variation 2: Teach to a Friend

**How it works:**
1. Find a study partner or friend
2. Take turns: One person teaches, one person learns
3. Listener asks questions when confused
4. Teacher explains until listener understands
5. Switch roles

**Benefits over rubber duck:**
- Real questions expose gaps you didn't anticipate
- Explaining the same thing multiple ways (when first explanation doesn't land)
- Listener's "aha!" moment confirms your explanation worked
- Social accountability (you've committed to teaching them)

**Protocol for maximum learning:**

**For the teacher:**
- Explain without notes
- Use simple language
- Check understanding: "Does that make sense?"
- Encourage questions

**For the learner:**
- Ask "why?" frequently
- Point out when you're confused
- Request examples
- Try to explain it back

**After teaching:**
- Teacher: Note where you struggled to explain
- Learner: Try teaching the same concept back (role reversal)

### Variation 3: Record Yourself

**How it works:**
1. Use phone/computer to record yourself explaining
2. Explain as if teaching a YouTube video
3. Play it back and listen critically
4. Note where you:
   - Used filler words ("um," "like," "basically")
   - Got stuck or repeated yourself
   - Used jargon without defining it
   - Sounded confused or uncertain

**Benefits:**
- Hear yourself as others hear you
- Identify verbal crutches and unclear phrasing
- Create study material (can listen to recording later)
- Practice for oral exams or presentations

**Advanced version - Video recording:**
- Record video of yourself teaching (use webcam)
- Watch yourself teach
- Evaluate:
  - Body language (do you look confident or confused?)
  - Eye contact (with camera = with audience)
  - Pace (too fast? too slow?)
  - Clarity of explanation

**Critique yourself:**
```
- 0:30 - I used the word "basically" three times. Filler word, cut it.
- 1:15 - I said "it's complicated" instead of explaining. That's a gap.
- 2:00 - I defined mitochondria but didn't explain why cells need energy.
- 3:30 - Good! The analogy to a power plant was clear.
```

**When to use:**
- Preparing for oral exams
- Creating study materials for commute
- When you want to be especially self-critical
- Building presentation skills

### Variation 4: Use AI/LLM as Teaching Audience

**How it works:**
1. Tell the AI: "I'm going to teach you about X as if you're a 10-year-old. Stop me when something is unclear."
2. Explain the concept
3. AI asks clarifying questions (simulating a student)
4. You answer the questions
5. AI points out gaps or suggests simplifications

**Benefits:**
- Available 24/7 (no scheduling needed)
- Won't judge you (vs fear of looking dumb to real person)
- Can be tuned to different "student" levels (5th grader, college student, expert)
- Provides feedback on your explanation

**Sample prompt:**
```
"I'm going to explain photosynthesis to you. Pretend you're a 5th grader who is
curious but doesn't know biology terms. As I explain, ask questions whenever:
- I use a word you wouldn't know
- Something doesn't make sense
- You want an example
- The explanation is too abstract

Be an active, curious student. Make me simplify and clarify."
```

**After explaining:**
```
"Now critique my explanation:
1. Where did I use jargon without defining it?
2. Where should I have given examples?
3. What analogies would make it clearer?
4. Did I explain WHY or just WHAT?
5. What questions would a real 5th grader still have?"
```

### Variation 5: Voice Recording for Commute Review

**How it works:**
1. Record yourself teaching a concept (audio only)
2. Save to phone
3. Listen during commute/walk/exercise
4. Reinforce your own understanding through spaced repetition

**Benefits:**
- Turns dead time (commute) into study time
- Hearing information in YOUR voice (familiar, trustworthy)
- Passive review after active creation
- Portable study material

**Creating a "lecture series for yourself":**

```
Week 1: Record 5 explanations (one per day)
Week 2: Record 5 new explanations + listen to Week 1 recordings (spaced repetition)
Week 3: Record 5 new explanations + listen to Week 1 & 2 recordings
Week 4: Listen to all recordings (exam prep)
```

**Tips:**
- Keep recordings to 5-10 minutes (attention span)
- Title clearly: "Bio - Cell Respiration - Krebs Cycle"
- Note date recorded (for spacing calculation)
- Re-record if you catch errors in explanation

### Variation 6: Write a Blog Post or Study Guide

**How it works:**
1. Write a blog post/document explaining the concept
2. Write for a specific audience (classmate who missed lecture, younger sibling, internet stranger)
3. Include:
   - Clear explanation in simple language
   - Examples and analogies
   - Diagrams if helpful
   - "Why this matters" section
4. Publish it (blog, study document, social media) or just keep it

**Benefits:**
- Writing forces even more precision than speaking
- Creating diagrams deepens understanding
- Organizing thoughts into structure (intro, body, conclusion)
- Helping others (if you share it)
- Portfolio of knowledge (look back to review)

**Example topics:**
- "Opportunity Cost Explained (With Real Examples)"
- "Understanding DNA Replication: The Simple Version"
- "Calculus Derivatives: What They Actually Mean"
- "The Water Cycle: Why It Matters More Than You Think"

## When to Use the Feynman Technique

**Not a replacement for initial learning** - You need to learn material first (lecture, reading) before you can teach it.

**Best used for:**

### 1. After Initial Learning (Deepening Phase)

**Timeline:**
- Attend lecture or read chapter (initial exposure)
- Same day or next day: Use Feynman Technique to deepen

**Why this timing:**
- Material is fresh enough to recall
- But not so fresh that gaps aren't apparent yet
- Deepens encoding before first review

### 2. When You're Stuck on a Concept

**Scenario:** You've read the textbook three times and still don't "get it."

**Why Feynman helps:**
- Reveals SPECIFICALLY what you don't understand (not just "I don't get derivatives")
- Turns vague confusion into targeted questions
- Forces different perspective (teaching vs consuming)

**Protocol:**
1. Attempt to teach it
2. Identify the exact point where you get stuck
3. Research that specific point
4. Try teaching again

### 3. Before Exams (Testing Understanding)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks before exam

**Use Feynman as diagnostic:**
- Can you teach every major concept?
- Which ones have gaps?
- Those are your study priorities

**Example:**
```
Bio exam in 2 weeks, covering 10 major topics.

Feynman test on all 10:
✓ Cell structure - can explain clearly
✓ Mitosis - can explain clearly
✗ Meiosis - got stuck on crossing over and independent assortment
✓ Cell respiration - can explain clearly
✗ Photosynthesis - confused about light-dependent vs independent reactions
✓ DNA structure - can explain clearly
✗ DNA replication - gap in understanding lagging strand
✓ Protein synthesis - can explain clearly
✗ Gene regulation - don't understand how it works
✓ Evolution - can explain clearly

Study priorities: Meiosis, Photosynthesis, DNA replication, Gene regulation
```

**You've just identified exactly what to study instead of wasting time reviewing what you already know.**

### 4. For Concepts That Connect Multiple Ideas

**Best for:**
- Systems thinking (water cycle, economic systems, ecosystems)
- Processes (photosynthesis, cell division, problem-solving methods)
- Theories (evolution, supply and demand, theories of psychology)

**Not as useful for:**
- Pure memorization (dates, vocabulary, formulas)
- Simple facts (capitals, definitions)

For those, use flashcards instead.

### 5. When Preparing to Actually Teach Others

**Scenarios:**
- Study group where you'll explain a topic
- Tutoring
- Presentation
- Teaching assistant role

**Protocol:**
1. Use Feynman to prepare
2. Identify gaps and fill them
3. Teach the real audience
4. Note what questions they ask
5. Refine explanation
6. Teach again to someone else

**Your explanation gets better each iteration.**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Teaching at Too High a Level

**Mistake:** "I'll explain it as if teaching a college student."

**Problem:**
- College students know jargon - you won't catch yourself using undefined terms
- Gaps remain hidden
- Defeats the purpose

**Fix:**
- Genuinely pretend you're teaching a 10-year-old
- If you use a technical term, define it immediately in simple words
- Test: Would your explanation make sense to your younger sibling/cousin?

### 2. Reading Your Explanation Instead of Teaching

**Mistake:** Looking at notes while "teaching."

**Problem:**
- You're reading, not retrieving
- Gaps don't emerge if you're copying
- Not simulating the recall needed for exams

**Fix:**
- Close all materials
- Teach from memory
- Only check sources when you hit a gap

### 3. Skipping Over Gaps

**Mistake:** "...and then it works... and then you get the result."

**Problem:**
- The gaps are WHERE YOU NEED TO LEARN
- Skipping them means you learn nothing new
- You're confirming what you know, not addressing what you don't

**Fix:**
- Mark every gap explicitly
- Don't move forward until gap is filled
- The stuck points are the learning points

### 4. Using the Technique for Everything

**Mistake:** "I'll use Feynman to learn every vocabulary word."

**Problem:**
- Feynman is for UNDERSTANDING, not memorization
- Some things just need flashcards (formulas, dates, terms)
- Overuse wastes time

**Fix:**
- Use Feynman for concepts and processes
- Use flashcards for facts and definitions
- Use practice problems for procedures

### 5. Never Actually Teaching Someone

**Mistake:** Only teaching to yourself or rubber duck.

**Problem:**
- Real audience asks unexpected questions
- You miss gaps that seem obvious to someone learning fresh
- No feedback on clarity

**Fix:**
- After preparing with Feynman, teach a real person at least once
- Their questions will reveal final gaps
- Their understanding confirms your explanation works

### 6. Making It Too Long

**Mistake:** 30-minute explanation of a simple concept.

**Problem:**
- If it takes 30 minutes, it's not simple yet
- Length often indicates you don't understand deeply (rambling to cover uncertainty)
- Not sustainable for multiple topics

**Fix:**
- Aim for 5-10 minute explanations
- If longer, you're either:
  - Trying to explain too much at once (break into smaller concepts)
  - Don't understand it simply enough (go back to step 4)
  - Including unnecessary details (focus on core concept)

**Feynman's wisdom:** "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."

If your explanation is complicated, that's feedback about your understanding, not the topic's difficulty.

## Integration with Other Techniques

### Feynman + Active Recall

**Sequence:**
1. Learn concept (lecture/reading)
2. Active recall (close book, try to remember)
3. Feynman (teach it simply)
4. Active recall again (now testing the deeper understanding)

**Why this works:**
- Active recall identifies what you remember
- Feynman identifies what you truly understand
- Different levels of testing

### Feynman + Spaced Repetition

**Teach the same concept at spaced intervals:**

```
Day 1: Teach it (identify gaps, fill them)
Day 3: Teach it again (should be smoother)
Week 1: Teach it again (should be automatic)
Week 2: Teach it again (maintenance)
```

**Each teaching session:**
- Strengthens understanding
- Reveals new connections
- Becomes easier and faster

### Feynman + Elaboration

**Feynman IS elaboration** through teaching.

When teaching:
- You generate examples (elaboration)
- You create analogies (elaboration)
- You connect to prior knowledge (elaboration)
- You explain significance (elaboration)

**The teaching frame automatically triggers elaborative thinking.**

### Feynman + Practice Testing

**Use Feynman to prepare for conceptual essay questions:**

**Exam question:** "Explain the process of natural selection and why it leads to evolution."

**Preparation:**
1. Use Feynman to teach yourself natural selection
2. Record your explanation
3. Refine it
4. Practice writing it as a timed essay
5. Compare your essay to your teaching - same depth?

**Result:** You've practiced both the understanding (Feynman) and the writing (practice test).

## LLM-ACTIONABLE-INSIGHTS

### For Students Using AI Assistants

**Prompt Templates for Feynman Technique:**

```
I'm going to use the Feynman Technique to learn about [CONCEPT].

Step 1: I'll explain it to you as if you're a 10-year-old. Stop me whenever:
- I use jargon without defining it
- Something doesn't make sense
- You'd like an example
- I'm being too abstract

Ready? Here's my explanation:

[Student explains]

After I finish, tell me:
1. Where I used jargon
2. What parts were unclear
3. What questions a real 10-year-old would still have
4. Suggested analogies to make it simpler
```

```
I'm stuck trying to simply explain [CONCEPT].

Here's as far as I got before getting stuck:
[Student's partial explanation]

I'm stuck at: [specific gap]

Help me:
1. What's a simple way to explain this part?
2. What analogy would work?
3. What example would illustrate this?
4. What am I missing in my understanding?

Don't just explain it for me - help me figure out how to explain it simply myself.
```

```
I just learned about [CONCEPT] in class.

Quiz me using the Feynman method:
1. Ask me to explain it to you as a 5th grader
2. When I use jargon, call me out
3. When something is unclear, ask "what do you mean?"
4. When I'm vague, ask "can you give an example?"
5. Be a curious but confused student

Make me work to explain it clearly.
```

```
I'm going to teach you [CONCEPT] from memory (no notes).

As I teach, you:
- Track how many times I use jargon without defining it
- Note where I skip steps in the explanation
- Identify when I'm vague or uncertain
- Point out where an analogy would help

After I finish, give me a report card:
- Clarity: /10
- Simplicity: /10
- Completeness: /10
- Examples/analogies used: /10

Then tell me specifically how to improve the explanation.
```

```
Here's my Feynman-style explanation of [CONCEPT]:

[Paste full explanation]

Critique it as if you're the 10-year-old audience:
1. What parts would confuse me?
2. Where would I ask "why?"
3. What words don't I know?
4. Where do I need a picture/diagram?
5. Is it interesting or boring? (be honest)

Help me make it even simpler and clearer.
```

```
Create a Feynman challenge for me:

Pick a complex concept from [SUBJECT] that's genuinely hard to explain simply.

Then:
1. I'll attempt to explain it to you (as a 5th grader)
2. You play a curious 5th grader with LOTS of "why" questions
3. Keep asking follow-up questions until I hit a gap
4. When I hit a gap, tell me what to research
5. I'll research and try again

This will stress-test my understanding.
```

### For LLMs Coaching Students

**When a student asks you to explain something:**

1. **Flip the script - make them teach you**
   ```
   Student: Can you explain photosynthesis?

   LLM: I could, but you'll learn it better if YOU explain it to ME.
   Pretend I'm a 5th grader who just asked "how do plants make food?"

   Go ahead - teach me! I'll ask questions if I'm confused.
   ```

2. **Be an active, questioning student**
   ```
   Student: "Plants use sunlight to make food through photosynthesis."

   LLM: "What do you mean 'use sunlight'? Like, they eat it?"

   Student: "No, they use the light's energy to convert CO2 and water to glucose."

   LLM: "What's CO2? And what's glucose? Are those foods?"

   [Continue pushing for simpler explanations]
   ```

3. **Point out jargon immediately**
   ```
   Student: "The chloroplasts contain chlorophyll..."

   LLM: "Stop! I'm 10 years old. What's a chloroplast? What's chlorophyll?
   Explain without using science words."
   ```

4. **Request examples and analogies**
   ```
   LLM: "I kind of get it, but can you give me an example from real life?
   Or compare it to something I already know?"
   ```

5. **After they teach, provide structured feedback**
   ```
   "Great job! Here's my feedback:

   What you did well:
   - You defined 'photosynthesis' without jargon
   - The analogy to a kitchen making food was perfect
   - You explained WHY plants need this (for energy)

   What to improve:
   - You used 'chlorophyll' without explaining what it is
   - You skipped over HOW light energy converts to chemical energy
   - You could add an example about why we need plants

   Want to try explaining again with these improvements?"
   ```

6. **Guide them to their gaps**
   ```
   Student: "...and then it just makes glucose."

   LLM: "Wait, you jumped from 'plants have chlorophyll' to 'they make glucose.'
   What happens in between? Walk me through it step by step."

   Student: "Um... I'm not actually sure..."

   LLM: "Perfect! You found a gap. That's the whole point of the Feynman
   Technique. You THOUGHT you understood photosynthesis, but when you tried
   to teach it, you discovered you're missing the middle steps.

   Now you know exactly what to study: the specific mechanism of how light
   energy drives the chemical reactions.

   Go research that, then come back and teach me again."
   ```

**Sample Coaching Dialog:**

```
Student: I'm studying cellular respiration. Can you explain it?

LLM: I'd rather YOU explain it to ME. That's how you'll actually learn it.

Imagine I'm your 10-year-old cousin who asked "why do we need to breathe?"
Teach me about cellular respiration in a way I'd understand.

Student: Okay. When you breathe, you take in oxygen. Your cells use that oxygen
to break down sugar and make energy.

LLM: Ooh, energy! Like, I'll have more energy to run around?

Student: Well, it's energy for your cells to work. ATP is the energy molecule.

LLM: What's ATP? And what do you mean "cells need energy to work"? What work
do cells do?

Student: Um... cells do lots of things like... growing and moving and stuff.
ATP is like... the energy currency. It powers those activities.

LLM: Okay, so ATP is like money for cells? They spend it on doing stuff?

Student: Yeah! Exactly!

LLM: Cool! So how do cells make this ATP money?

Student: They break down glucose - that's sugar from food - using oxygen. This
happens in the mitochondria.

LLM: How does breaking down sugar make ATP? Like, if I break a cookie, I don't
get money...

Student: Well... [thinking]... I think there's a process... with electrons moving
and... hmm. I know it happens in stages. Glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and... electron
transport chain?

LLM: You're listing names, but do you know what happens in each? Can you explain
glycolysis without using that word?

Student: Honestly, not really. I know the NAMES of the stages but not what
actually happens.

LLM: Perfect! You just used the Feynman Technique effectively. You discovered:

✓ You CAN explain: the basic purpose (oxygen + glucose → ATP energy)
✓ You CAN explain: the analogy (ATP as currency)
✓ You CAN explain: where it happens (mitochondria)

✗ You CAN'T explain: the specific mechanism of each stage
✗ You CAN'T explain: how breaking down glucose produces ATP

Now you know exactly what to study. Go learn about glycolysis, Krebs cycle,
and electron transport chain - not just the names, but what HAPPENS in each.

Then come back and teach me again with those gaps filled.

Student: That actually really helps. I thought I knew cellular respiration, but
I only knew the overview.

LLM: That's the magic of the Feynman Technique. It reveals the difference between
recognizing concepts and truly understanding them.

Ready to go fill those gaps? Come back when you can explain the full process
to a 10-year-old!

### Prompts for Feynman Practice

**For concept mastery:**
```
I need to master [CONCEPT] at a deep level, not just memorize it.

Be my Feynman coach:
1. I'll explain it to you (as a 5th grader)
2. You act like a curious 5th grader with endless "why?" questions
3. Push me until I hit a gap
4. When I hit a gap, tell me what to research (specific, not "study more")
5. After I research, I'll explain again
6. Repeat until I can explain with zero gaps

This is stress-testing my understanding. Be tough on me.

Ready? Here's my first attempt: [explanation]
```

**For exam prep:**
```
I have an exam with essay questions on [TOPIC].

Help me prepare using Feynman:
1. Generate 5 essay questions I might see
2. For each question, I'll explain my answer as if teaching
3. You point out where my explanation has gaps or unclear parts
4. I refine my explanation
5. We repeat until I can clearly explain all 5 topics

This combines Feynman (understanding) with practice testing (exam prep).
```

**For difficult concepts:**
```
I've read about [CONCEPT] three times and still don't really get it.

Let's use Feynman to diagnose exactly what I don't understand:

1. I'll attempt to explain it simply
2. You identify the EXACT point where my explanation breaks down
3. That's the specific gap I need to study
4. You give me targeted resources for just that gap
5. I learn it and try explaining again

The goal is precision: not "I don't get quantum mechanics," but "I don't
understand why wave functions collapse upon observation."

Let's start. Here's my attempt: [explanation]

## Summary: Teach to Understand

**The Feynman insight:** The ultimate test of knowledge is the ability to teach.

**Why the Feynman Technique works:**
- Teaching requires generation, not just recognition
- Simple language forces deep understanding
- Gaps become obvious when you try to explain
- You can't fake it when someone is listening

**The 4 steps:**
1. Choose a concept
2. Teach it simply (like to a child)
3. Identify gaps when you get stuck
4. Learn those gaps, then teach again

**The variations:**
- Rubber duck (always available, no judgment)
- Friend (real questions, accountability)
- Recording (self-critique, study material)
- AI (24/7 availability, simulated student)
- Writing (blog post, study guide)

**When to use:**
- After initial learning (deepen understanding)
- When stuck (reveal specific gaps)
- Before exams (test understanding)
- For complex concepts (systems, processes, theories)

**The test:**
Can you explain it to a 10-year-old? If yes, you understand it. If no, you've found your next study focus.

**Feynman's legacy:**
He could explain quantum electrodynamics, particle physics, and complex mathematics to anyone because he understood them simply himself.

You don't need to be Feynman to use his technique. You just need to be willing to confront what you don't know by trying to teach it.

Start teaching. Start learning.
