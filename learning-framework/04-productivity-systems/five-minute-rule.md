# Five-Minute Rule: Overcoming Procrastination

## The Core Concept

**The Five-Minute Rule is brutally simple:**

When you're procrastinating on a task, commit to working on it for **just 5 minutes**. That's it.

Not 30 minutes. Not "until it's done." Just 5 minutes.

After 5 minutes, you're free to stop if you want to.

---

## Why This Works: The Psychology

### 1. Reduces Perceived Task Size

**The procrastination trap:**
- Your brain sees: "Write entire 10-page essay" or "Study for exam (4 hours needed)"
- Brain's response: "That's overwhelming. Let's avoid it by scrolling TikTok."

**The five-minute reframe:**
- Your brain sees: "Work on essay for 5 minutes"
- Brain's response: "5 minutes? That's nothing. I can do that."

**What happens:** The task suddenly feels manageable. The barrier to starting shrinks dramatically.

---

### 2. Getting Started Is the Hardest Part

**Newton's First Law (applied to productivity):**
- An object at rest stays at rest
- An object in motion stays in motion

**Translation:**
- When you're procrastinating (at rest), staying in procrastination is easy
- Once you start working (in motion), continuing to work is easier than you think

**The data:** 8 out of 10 times, once you start the "5-minute" task, you'll continue past 5 minutes.

**Why?**
- **Activation energy is highest at the start.** Once you overcome that initial resistance, momentum takes over.
- **The task is rarely as bad as you feared.** Often the anticipation is worse than the reality.
- **You enter a "completion mindset."** Once you start, your brain wants to finish.

**Example:**
- Before: "I don't want to study chemistry. It's going to be awful."
- 5-minute rule: "Fine, I'll do 5 minutes."
- After 5 minutes: "Actually, this isn't that bad. I'll keep going."
- Result: 30-45 minutes of focused study

---

### 3. It's a Commitment You Can Keep

**The trust issue with yourself:**

If you constantly tell yourself "I'll study for 3 hours" and then quit after 20 minutes, you stop believing your own commitments.

**The five-minute rule rebuilds trust:**
- You commit to 5 minutes
- You CAN definitely do 5 minutes
- You keep the commitment
- You prove to yourself that you do what you say

**Over time:** Your brain learns to trust your intentions, making it easier to start tasks.

---

### 4. Removes the "All or Nothing" Pressure

**The perfectionist trap:**
- "If I can't do this perfectly/completely right now, I won't start."
- "I don't have 3 hours, so there's no point starting."

**The five-minute rule says:**
- "Any progress is good progress."
- "5 minutes is infinitely more than 0 minutes."

**Reality check:**
- 5 minutes of studying > 0 minutes of studying
- 5 minutes of writing > 0 minutes of writing
- 5 minutes of cleaning > 0 minutes of cleaning

Even if you stop after 5 minutes, you've made progress. That matters.

---

### 5. Bypasses the Motivation Myth

**The myth:** "I need to feel motivated to start."

**The truth:** Motivation comes AFTER starting, not before.

**The cycle most people expect:**
1. Feel motivated
2. Start working
3. Make progress

**The actual cycle:**
1. Start working (even without motivation)
2. Make progress
3. Feel motivated

**The five-minute rule leverages this:**
- You don't wait for motivation
- You commit to 5 minutes without requiring motivation
- After starting, motivation appears

---

## The Sand Timer Method: Physical Implementation

**Why a physical sand timer?**

The five-minute rule works best with a **physical, analog timer**—specifically a sand timer (hourglass).

### Why Sand Timer Over Phone Timer?

**Phone timer problems:**
1. You pick up your phone to set the timer
2. You see a notification
3. You "just quickly check" something
4. 20 minutes later, you haven't started
5. You've made the procrastination worse

**Sand timer advantages:**
1. **Single-purpose:** It does one thing—count time
2. **No digital distraction:** Can't check social media on a sand timer
3. **Visual:** You see the sand falling—tangible progress
4. **Satisfying:** Flipping it is a ritual that signals "I'm starting now"
5. **Calming:** The sand falling is meditative, reduces anxiety about the task

**Recommendation:** Get a 5-minute sand timer (available online for $5-15). Keep it on your desk.

---

### The Five-Minute Rule Ritual (with Sand Timer)

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Identify the task you're avoiding.**
   - "I need to start the chemistry problem set."

2. **Remove obvious distractions.**
   - Phone across the room (or in another room entirely)
   - Close irrelevant browser tabs
   - Clear your desk of non-essentials

3. **Place the sand timer where you can see it.**
   - On your desk, in your peripheral vision

4. **Make a micro-commitment.**
   - Say out loud (yes, actually say it): "I will work on this for 5 minutes."

5. **Flip the sand timer.**
   - This physical action is the trigger: "I am starting NOW."

6. **Begin the task immediately.**
   - Don't wait, don't prepare further, just start
   - Write one sentence, read one paragraph, solve one problem

7. **Work until the sand runs out.**
   - 5 minutes. That's it.

8. **When the timer ends, check in with yourself:**
   - "Do I want to keep going?"
   - 80% of the time: Yes → Flip the timer again and continue
   - 20% of the time: No → Stop. That's okay. You did 5 minutes.

---

## Using the Timer as a Focus Anchor

**The timer isn't just for starting—it's for MAINTAINING focus.**

### The Wandering Mind Problem

**What happens during focused work:**
- You're working on the task
- Your mind wanders: "I wonder if anyone texted me"
- You feel the urge to check your phone
- Focus is broken

### The Timer as Your Anchor

**When your attention wanders:**

1. **Notice the urge to get distracted**
   - "I want to check my phone" / "I want to see what's on Reddit"

2. **Look at the sand timer**
   - See the sand still falling
   - Remind yourself: "I committed to 5 minutes"

3. **Redirect attention back to the task**
   - "I can check my phone in [X minutes when the sand runs out]. Right now, I'm working."

**Why this works:**
- The timer gives you a **concrete endpoint**
- You're not saying "never check your phone"
- You're saying "not for the next 3 minutes"
- That's manageable
- Your brain can wait 3 minutes

**The sand timer becomes a visual reminder:** "I'm in focus mode right now."

---

## What If You Stop After 5 Minutes?

**This is okay. Seriously.**

### Why It's Still a Win

1. **You made progress:** 5 minutes of work > 0 minutes
2. **You kept your commitment:** You said 5 minutes, you did 5 minutes
3. **You practiced starting:** The skill of beginning tasks is being built
4. **You reduced the intimidation factor:** Next time, the task will feel less scary

**The data:** Even if you stop after 5 minutes, you've often done more than you think.

**Example:**
- 5 minutes of reading = 2-3 pages (more than 0)
- 5 minutes of writing = 100-150 words (more than 0)
- 5 minutes of flashcards = 10-15 cards reviewed (more than 0)

**Compound effect:** If you do "just 5 minutes" three times a day, that's 15 minutes of focused work you wouldn't have done otherwise.

Over a week: 105 minutes (1.75 hours)
Over a semester (15 weeks): 26.25 hours

**26 hours of focused work on something you were previously avoiding entirely.**

---

### When You Stop, Try Again Later

**If you stop after 5 minutes in the morning:**
- That's okay
- Try another 5-minute session in the afternoon
- And maybe another in the evening

**No shame, no guilt.** Each 5-minute attempt is valuable.

**The goal isn't to become a machine.** The goal is to make consistent progress despite resistance.

---

## Pairing with Environment Design

**The five-minute rule is MORE effective when combined with environmental setup.**

### Before You Start Your 5 Minutes: Design Your Environment

**Remove distractions:**
1. **Phone:** In another room, or at minimum face-down across the room
2. **Computer:** Close all tabs except what you need for the task
3. **People:** If possible, go somewhere you won't be interrupted (library, empty classroom, study room)
4. **Noise:** Headphones with focus music, white noise, or silence

**Set up what you need:**
1. **Materials ready:** Textbook open to the right page, notebook out, pen in hand
2. **Water nearby:** Don't give yourself an excuse to get up
3. **Comfortable but alert:** Good posture, good lighting
4. **Timer visible:** Sand timer or Pomodoro timer on desk

**Why this matters:**
If you commit to 5 minutes but then spend 3 of those minutes finding your textbook and getting settled, you've only got 2 minutes of actual work. That's not enough to build momentum.

**The rule:** Set up FIRST, then start the 5-minute timer.

---

### Environment Design Checklist

**Before flipping the sand timer, check:**
- [ ] Phone is out of reach
- [ ] Computer has only necessary tabs open (or is closed if not needed)
- [ ] All materials for the task are within arm's reach
- [ ] I have water/coffee (won't need to get up)
- [ ] I'm in a place where I can focus (not high-traffic area)
- [ ] I know exactly what I'm doing in the next 5 minutes (specific task, not vague)

**Once all boxes are checked:** Flip the timer, start immediately.

---

## Progression: Building the Habit

**The five-minute rule is a gateway.**

It's not meant to be your permanent system. It's meant to **lower the barrier** until starting becomes automatic.

### Week 1-2: Pure 5-Minute Sessions

**Goal:** Just practice starting.

- Use the 5-minute rule every time you procrastinate
- Track: How often did you continue past 5 minutes?
- Celebrate: Every time you start, even if you stop at 5

**Metrics to track:**
- Number of 5-minute sessions started per day
- Percentage of sessions where you continued past 5 minutes
- Total time worked (from all sessions combined)

---

### Week 3-4: Extend When You Feel Momentum

**Goal:** Notice when you WANT to keep going, and allow it.

- Start with 5-minute commitment
- When the timer runs out, ask: "Do I want to keep going?"
- If yes: Flip the timer again (another 5 minutes)
- Build chains: "I did three 5-minute timers in a row = 15 minutes of focused work"

**What you'll notice:**
- After 2-3 timer flips (10-15 min), you're often in flow
- At that point, you might not need the timer anymore
- Let the work carry you

---

### Week 5-6: Transition to Longer Intervals

**Goal:** Graduate from 5-minute rule to Pomodoro or longer focused blocks.

- Start with 5-minute rule to overcome activation energy
- Once you're working, switch to 25-minute Pomodoro timer
- The 5-minute rule becomes just the "ignition," not the whole engine

**Example:**
```
2pm: Procrastinating on essay
2:05pm: "Okay, just 5 minutes" (flip sand timer)
2:10pm: Timer ends, but I'm writing and it's flowing
2:10pm: Switch to 25-minute Pomodoro timer
2:35pm: Pomodoro ends, take 5-min break
2:40pm: Start another 25-min Pomodoro (no 5-min rule needed, momentum exists)
```

**The transition:** You stop needing the 5-minute rule for every session. Only when you're particularly resistant.

---

### Long-Term: Internalize the Habit

**Eventually:** The habit of starting becomes automatic.

**What changes:**
- You see a task → You start it (minimal resistance)
- You don't need the 5-minute rule as often
- When you DO procrastinate, you have a reliable tool to overcome it

**The five-minute rule becomes your emergency rescue tool, not your daily driver.**

---

## Practical Examples: Five-Minute Rule in Action

### Example 1: Essay You've Been Avoiding

**Situation:** You have an essay due in 3 days. You haven't started. Every time you think about it, you feel dread and open Instagram instead.

**Applying the rule:**
1. "I will work on the essay for just 5 minutes."
2. Set up: Open a blank document, close other tabs, phone away
3. Flip sand timer
4. Start: "I'll just write the first sentence of the introduction."
5. 5 minutes pass: You've written 3 sentences and have momentum
6. "I'll do another 5 minutes."
7. After second timer: You've got a paragraph and ideas are flowing
8. Continue for 30 more minutes without needing the timer

**Result:** Essay is started. The hardest part (beginning) is done.

---

### Example 2: Textbook Reading You're Dreading

**Situation:** You need to read 30 pages of dense biology textbook. It's boring and hard. You've been putting it off for days.

**Applying the rule:**
1. "I will read for just 5 minutes."
2. Set up: Open textbook to correct page, highlighter ready, phone away
3. Flip sand timer
4. Start: Begin reading, even if slowly
5. 5 minutes pass: You've read 2 pages
6. Check in: "That wasn't as bad as I thought. I'll do another 5."
7. Repeat 3 more times
8. Total: 20 minutes of reading, 8 pages done

**Result:** Made significant progress. Tomorrow will be easier because you've built momentum.

---

### Example 3: Math Problem Set (Feels Impossible)

**Situation:** Problem set with 20 questions. They're hard. You don't even know where to start. Anxiety spiraling.

**Applying the rule:**
1. "I will work on this for just 5 minutes. Just attempt problem #1."
2. Set up: Problem set out, scratch paper ready, calculator nearby, phone away
3. Flip sand timer
4. Start: Read problem #1, write down what you know
5. 5 minutes pass: You've started the problem, maybe not solved it yet
6. Check in: "I'll try for 5 more minutes to finish this problem."
7. 10 minutes total: Problem #1 is done
8. "I'll do one more problem" (flip timer again)

**Result:** 2-3 problems completed in 15-20 minutes. The wall is broken. Rest of the problem set feels more approachable.

---

### Example 4: Cleaning Your Room (Procrastination Isn't Just Academic)

**Situation:** Your room is a disaster. Clean clothes mixed with dirty, papers everywhere. The thought of cleaning is overwhelming.

**Applying the rule:**
1. "I will clean for just 5 minutes."
2. Set up: Put on music (optional), grab a trash bag
3. Flip sand timer
4. Start: Pick up trash only, nothing else
5. 5 minutes pass: Trash is gone, room already looks better
6. "5 more minutes, I'll just organize the desk."
7. Continue in 5-minute increments

**Result:** After 20-30 minutes (4-6 timer flips), room is clean. Each 5-minute chunk felt manageable.

---

## When NOT to Use the Five-Minute Rule

**The five-minute rule is powerful, but it's not for everything.**

### Don't Use For:

**1. Tasks that genuinely require deep preparation**
- Example: Can't "just start" a lab experiment without reading the procedure
- Use instead: 5-minute rule to start the PREP work (reading the procedure)

**2. Creative work that requires specific inspiration**
- Example: Writing poetry, composing music, painting
- These may need space and spontaneity, not forced starting
- Use instead: 5-minute rule for generative practices (free-writing, sketching) that might lead to inspiration

**3. Rest and recovery time**
- Example: "I'll relax for just 5 minutes"
- This defeats the purpose of rest (you need more than 5 minutes to recover)

**4. Tasks you genuinely shouldn't be doing**
- Example: Procrastinating on assignment A by using 5-minute rule to start assignment B
- Addresses the wrong problem

**5. Complex decisions**
- Example: "I'll just decide on my major in 5 minutes"
- Some things need time and thought, not quick action

---

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

### Obstacle 1: "I Don't Even Want to Do 5 Minutes"

**The resistance is THAT strong.**

**Solution: Go smaller.**
- "I'll just open the document" (no timer, just that one action)
- "I'll just read the assignment prompt" (that's it)
- "I'll just organize my materials" (prep only)

**Micro-commitments that are literally 30 seconds.**

Once you do the tiny action, the 5-minute rule becomes easier.

---

### Obstacle 2: "I Keep Getting Distracted Within the 5 Minutes"

**Can't even maintain focus for 5 minutes.**

**Solution: Environmental control.**
- Phone must be in another room (not just face-down)
- Work in library or coffee shop (harder to access distractions)
- Use website blocker (Freedom, Cold Turkey, etc.)
- Have someone hold you accountable (study with a friend who will call you out)

**If that still doesn't work:**
- Shorten to 3 minutes
- Or try 1 minute just to practice the skill of focusing

---

### Obstacle 3: "I Stop After 5 Minutes Every Time"

**Never continuing past the initial 5 minutes.**

**Possible reasons:**
1. **The task is genuinely not ready to be worked on:** Need more prep, clarification, resources
2. **Timing is wrong:** Maybe you're trying during low-energy time of day
3. **The task is too big and undefined:** "Work on essay" is too vague; try "Write one sentence of the intro"
4. **Underlying anxiety or avoidance:** Might need to address deeper issue (talk to counselor, break down fears)

**Solution:**
- Assess if the task is actually ready to work on
- Try the 5-minute rule during your peak energy time
- Make the task MORE specific for the 5 minutes
- If it's anxiety-based, address that first (maybe the 5 minutes is exposure therapy, and that's valuable in itself)

---

### Obstacle 4: "I Feel Guilty for Only Doing 5 Minutes"

**Internal voice says 5 minutes isn't enough.**

**Solution: Reframe.**
- 5 minutes is infinitely more than 0 minutes
- Consistency beats intensity: 5 minutes daily for 30 days = 2.5 hours total
- You're building the skill of starting, which is valuable long-term
- Progress is progress

**Mantra:** "5 minutes of action beats hours of intention."

## LLM-ACTIONABLE-INSIGHTS: Five-Minute Rule Deployment

*This section provides structured prompts for AI assistants to help implement the five-minute rule effectively.*

---

### PROMPT 1: Identify My Procrastination Triggers

**LLM prompt**:
```
I'm procrastinating on: [specific task]

Help me understand why by analyzing:
1. What about this task feels overwhelming?
2. What am I avoiding (boredom, difficulty, fear of failure, etc.)?
3. What's the specific moment where I bail (thinking about it, sitting down, opening materials)?
4. What do I do instead of the task (distraction patterns)?

Then design:
- A 5-minute rule protocol specifically for THIS task
- Environmental modifications to remove my specific distractions
- A micro-commitment (even smaller than 5 min) if needed
- What "success" looks like (hint: it's starting, not finishing)
```

---

### PROMPT 2: Design a 5-Minute Start Ritual

**LLM prompt**:
```
I want to use the 5-minute rule consistently. Help me create a starting ritual.

My situation:
- Where I study: [location]
- My main distractions: [list]
- Tools I have: [timer type, materials, etc.]
- Task I'm currently procrastinating on: [task]

Create a step-by-step ritual that:
1. Prepares my environment (specific actions)
2. Removes my distractions (specific actions)
3. Sets up materials needed (specific items)
4. Includes a verbal or physical trigger (what I say/do to START)
5. Specifies exactly what I'll do in the first 5 minutes
6. Has a check-in protocol when the 5 minutes end

Make it so specific I can't fail to follow it.
```

---

### PROMPT 3: Break Down an Overwhelming Task

**LLM prompt**:
```
This task feels way too big to start:
[Describe the overwhelming task]

Break it down into:
1. The absolute smallest first action (what can I do in 1 minute?)
2. A 5-minute chunk (what can I accomplish in 5 minutes?)
3. A 15-minute chunk (three 5-minute sessions)
4. A 30-minute chunk (six 5-minute sessions)

For each chunk, be SPECIFIC:
- Not "work on essay" → "Write the first sentence of the introduction"
- Not "study biology" → "Review flashcards 1-10"

Make each chunk feel stupidly easy.
```

---

### PROMPT 4: Troubleshoot My Failed Attempts

**LLM prompt**:
```
I tried the 5-minute rule and it didn't work. Here's what happened:

[Describe what went wrong - didn't start, got distracted immediately, stopped after 2 minutes, etc.]

Context:
- Time of day: [when I tried]
- Energy level: [how I felt]
- Environment: [where I was]
- What distracted me: [specific distractions]

Diagnose:
1. Why did this fail?
2. What adjustments should I make?
3. Should I try a shorter interval first?
4. Do I need different environmental controls?
5. Is timing the issue (wrong time of day)?

Provide a revised protocol to try next time.
```

---

### PROMPT 5: Create a Progression Plan

**LLM prompt**:
```
I want to build the habit of starting tasks easily (not procrastinating).

Current state:
- I procrastinate on: [types of tasks]
- How often: [daily, few times a week, etc.]
- My current success rate with starting: [estimate]

Create a 6-week progression plan:

Week 1-2: [how to use 5-minute rule, what to track]
Week 3-4: [how to extend sessions, when to push past 5 min]
Week 5-6: [transition to longer focus blocks]

Include:
- Daily practice (what to do each day)
- What to track (specific metrics)
- Success criteria (how to know it's working)
- Adjustments if I'm struggling or advancing faster than expected
```

---

### PROMPT 6: Design Environment Controls

**LLM prompt**:
```
My biggest problem: I get distracted before/during my 5-minute sessions.

My specific distractions:
- [List: phone, social media, roommate, noise, etc.]

My environment:
- Where I work: [dorm, library, home, etc.]
- What I control: [can I change location, noise, etc.]
- Tools available: [apps, physical barriers, etc.]

Design:
1. A distraction-removal protocol (step-by-step actions before starting 5-min timer)
2. Environmental modifications for my specific space
3. Accountability mechanisms (apps, people, etc.)
4. Backup plan (if distraction happens during the 5 minutes, what do I do?)

Be extremely specific about physical actions to take.
```

---

### PROMPT 7: Pair 5-Minute Rule with Other Techniques

**LLM prompt**:
```
I want to combine the 5-minute rule with [Pomodoro / Time-blocking / other technique].

My goal: [e.g., "Use 5-min rule to START, then switch to Pomodoro for sustained work"]

Design a hybrid protocol:
1. When to use 5-minute rule (starting, overcoming resistance)
2. When to transition to the other technique (once momentum exists)
3. How to structure the session overall
4. What to do if I lose momentum partway through

Example format:
- 5-min rule to start
- If I continue, switch to 25-min Pomodoro
- If I stop after 5 min, try again later with another 5-min attempt
```

---

### PROMPT 8: Emergency Procrastination Rescue

**LLM prompt**:
```
I have [task] due in [X hours/days] and I've been procrastinating badly.

Current state:
- How I'm feeling: [anxious, guilty, panicked, etc.]
- Why I've been avoiding it: [reason]
- How much time I realistically have: [be honest]

Create an emergency plan:
1. Smallest possible first action (micro-commitment)
2. 5-minute rule protocol for getting started RIGHT NOW
3. What to do if I stall (backup strategies)
4. Realistic expectation (what can I accomplish)
5. Self-compassion script (what to tell myself to reduce guilt spiral)

Focus on STARTING, not finishing perfectly.
```

---

### FRAMEWORK: 5-Minute Rule Decision Tree

**For LLM to help students decide how to use the rule**:

```
START HERE: Are you procrastinating on a task?

YES → Assess why:

  ├─ "Task feels overwhelming"
  │   └─ Use 5-minute rule with MICRO first action
  │       Example: "Just open the document and write one word"
  │
  ├─ "Don't know how to start"
  │   └─ Use 5-minute rule for PREP
  │       Example: "Spend 5 min reading the prompt and listing materials needed"
  │
  ├─ "It's boring/unpleasant"
  │   └─ Use 5-minute rule + reward
  │       Example: "5 min of work, then 5 min of something enjoyable"
  │
  ├─ "I'm anxious about doing it poorly"
  │   └─ Use 5-minute rule with PERMISSION to do it badly
  │       Example: "5 min of messy, imperfect work is the goal"
  │
  └─ "I just don't want to"
      └─ Use 5-minute rule + environmental control
          Example: "Remove all distractions, commit to just 5 min, then reassess"

DURING THE 5 MINUTES:

  ├─ Distracted → Look at timer, redirect attention
  ├─ Stuck → Keep going anyway, even if slowly
  └─ Flowing → Great, just keep working

AFTER 5 MINUTES:

  ├─ Want to continue → Flip timer again or switch to Pomodoro
  ├─ Want to stop → Stop. Count it as a win. Try again later.
  └─ Made progress but tired → Stop. Schedule next 5-min session for later today.
```

---

### INTEGRATION: 5-Minute Rule + Other Productivity Systems

**LLM can suggest combinations**:

**5-Minute Rule + Time-Blocking**:
```
Use 5-minute rule when a time-blocked session arrives and you don't want to start:
- 3pm time block: "Study chemistry"
- 3pm arrives, you're on your phone
- Use: "Just 5 minutes of chemistry, then I can decide"
- Usually: You continue for the full blocked time
```

**5-Minute Rule + Pomodoro**:
```
Use 5-minute rule as the ignition for Pomodoro:
- Start: 5-minute rule (just get started)
- After 5 min: Switch to 25-minute Pomodoro if you want to continue
- Benefit: Lower barrier to entry
```

**5-Minute Rule + 3-2-1 Method**:
```
Use 3-2-1 countdown to commit to the 5-minute rule:
- Count: 3... 2... 1...
- Action: Flip the sand timer and start immediately
- Combination eliminates hesitation entirely
```

---

### USAGE NOTES FOR LLMs

When helping students apply the 5-minute rule:

1. **Emphasize that stopping after 5 min is okay** - students feel guilty, reassure them
2. **Make the first action stupidly small** - if they're struggling, go micro
3. **Environment matters** - always ask about/address distractions
4. **It's a starting tool, not a finishing tool** - reframe expectations
5. **Pair with physical timer when possible** - recommend sand timer for phone addicts
6. **Track attempts, not just completions** - every attempt builds the habit
7. **Normalize failure** - "didn't work this time? try again in an hour"
8. **Progression is the goal** - 5-min rule should eventually become unnecessary
9. **Be specific about what to do in the 5 minutes** - vague tasks don't work
10. **Address underlying issues** - if it never works, there might be deeper anxiety/avoidance to address
