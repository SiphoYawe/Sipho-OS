# Optimized Breaks: Rest That Enhances Learning

## The Neuroscience: Why Rest Is When Learning Happens

**The common misconception:** Learning happens during study sessions.

**The reality:** Learning happens during study sessions AND during rest. Both are essential.

**What happens during study:**
- **Acetylcholine** (a neurotransmitter) is released
- It marks specific neurons with the signal: "This is important, pay attention"
- This is the TAGGING phase of learning

**What happens during rest:**
- Your brain REPLAYS the tagged experiences
- Neural connections are strengthened (synaptic consolidation)
- This is the INSTALLATION phase of learning

**The analogy:**
- Study session = Highlighting text in a book (marking what's important)
- Rest = Actually reading and absorbing what you highlighted

**Without rest, you're just highlighting—nothing gets absorbed.**

## Why All-Nighters Fail: The Sleep Deprivation Problem

**The all-nighter logic:**
- "I have an exam tomorrow"
- "If I stay up all night studying, I'll learn more"
- "Sleep is a waste of time when I could be studying"

**Why this fails:**

### 1. No Time for Neural Consolidation

**During sleep:**
- Your brain replays the day's learning at 20x speed
- Weak neural connections are pruned
- Strong connections (the important stuff) are reinforced
- Memory moves from short-term to long-term storage

**Without sleep:**
- None of this happens
- You've tagged information but haven't installed it
- Come exam time, the information isn't actually there

**Result:** You "studied" for 8 hours but retained maybe 20% of it.

---

### 2. Degraded Cognitive Function

**After 24 hours without sleep:**
- Reaction time equivalent to being legally drunk
- Working memory capacity drops by 40%
- Attention span collapses
- Emotional regulation fails (more anxiety, stress)

**During the exam:**
- You can't recall what you "know"
- You make careless mistakes
- You can't think through complex problems
- You feel terrible

**Result:** Even the 20% you retained is hard to access.

---

### 3. The Forgetting Accelerates

**Sleep deprivation accelerates forgetting.**

Studies show:
- Material learned with adequate sleep: 70-80% retained after one week
- Material learned sleep-deprived: 30-40% retained after one week

**You lose the knowledge faster**, even if you manage to cram some of it in.

---

**The data is clear: 7 hours of study + 7 hours of sleep > 14 hours of study + 0 hours of sleep**

Not even close. Sleep wins.

---

## NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest): The Powerful Alternative to Naps

**NSDR = Non-Sleep Deep Rest**

**Developed by:** Dr. Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist, Stanford)

**What it is:** Guided relaxation protocols that put you into a deep rest state without actual sleep.

**Why it's powerful:** Benefits similar to sleep for learning and recovery, but:
- Shorter (10-45 minutes vs. 90+ min for a full sleep cycle)
- Can be done anytime
- Don't risk grogginess from waking mid-sleep-cycle

---

### How NSDR Works

**The state:**
- You lie down, close your eyes
- Follow guided instructions (breath control, body awareness)
- Your brain enters a state between wakefulness and sleep
- **Theta brain waves** increase (same as light sleep)
- Nervous system shifts to parasympathetic mode (rest and digest)

**What happens during NSDR:**
- **Neural consolidation occurs** (like sleep)
- **Stress hormones drop** (cortisol decreases)
- **Dopamine production increases** (motivation and focus restore)
- **Mental fatigue reduces**

**Studies show:**
- 20 minutes of NSDR can restore focus equivalent to 60-90 minutes of regular rest
- Improves retention of material learned just before the session
- Reduces anxiety and improves mood

---

### NSDR Protocols to Try

**1. Yoga Nidra (Traditional NSDR)**
- 10-45 minute guided sessions
- Systematic body scan and relaxation
- Widely available on YouTube

**Recommended:**
- Search "Yoga Nidra 20 minutes" on YouTube
- Try different instructors to find a voice you like
- Madeline Rinehart, Ally Boothroyd, Jennifer Reis are popular

**When to use:** Mid-afternoon (2pm-4pm) when energy dips, or after intense study session

---

**2. Body Scan Meditation**
- 10-30 minutes
- Focus attention on each part of body sequentially
- Notice sensations without judgment

**How to do it:**
- Lie down comfortably
- Start at toes, progressively move attention up body
- Breathe deeply and relax each area
- Apps: Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer

**When to use:** Before bed (helps transition to sleep), or when feeling stressed

---

**3. Breathwork-Based NSDR**
- 5-20 minutes
- Focus on controlled breathing patterns
- Combines breath control with visualization

**Simple protocol:**
- Inhale for 4 counts
- Hold for 4 counts
- Exhale for 6 counts (longer exhale = more calming)
- Repeat for 10-20 minutes

**When to use:** Quick reset between study blocks, before exam (calms nerves)

---

**4. Hypnosis for Learning (Reveri App)**
- 10-15 minute sessions
- Specifically designed to enhance learning and memory
- Uses clinical hypnosis techniques

**When to use:** After study session (helps consolidate what you just learned)

---

### NSDR Best Practices

**1. Environment:**
- Quiet, dark or dim room
- Comfortable surface (bed, yoga mat, couch)
- Warm enough (body temperature drops during deep rest)

**2. Timing:**
- NOT right after a meal (digestion interferes)
- Ideal: 2-4pm (natural circadian dip) or after intense study block
- NOT right before something requiring immediate alertness (give yourself 5 min to transition)

**3. Consistency:**
- More effective with regular practice
- Try daily for 2 weeks to feel full benefits

**4. Don't worry if you fall asleep:**
- If you're exhausted, your body needs actual sleep
- NSDR is for when you're tired but not sleep-deprived

---

## Power Naps: The 20-30 Minute Window

**Power naps are effective, but timing is critical.**

### The Science of Nap Duration

**Sleep cycles:**
- Light sleep (Stage 1-2): 0-20 minutes
- Deep sleep (Stage 3): 20-60 minutes
- REM sleep: 60-90 minutes

**The power nap sweet spot: 20-30 minutes**

**Why this duration:**
- Long enough to enter light sleep (restorative)
- Short enough to avoid deep sleep
- Waking from light sleep = feel refreshed
- Waking from deep sleep = sleep inertia (groggy, worse than before)

---

### How to Take an Effective Power Nap

**1. Timing:**
- **Best time:** Early afternoon (1pm-3pm)
- Aligns with natural circadian dip
- Won't interfere with nighttime sleep
- **Avoid:** Late afternoon/evening (after 4pm) → disrupts nighttime sleep

**2. Set an alarm:**
- 20-25 minutes (not more)
- Use a gentle alarm (not jarring)
- Place phone/alarm across room (forces you to get up)

**3. Environment:**
- Dark room (or eye mask)
- Quiet (or white noise/earplugs)
- Comfortable temperature (slightly cool)
- Lie down if possible (sitting reduces quality)

**4. The coffee nap (advanced):**
- Drink coffee immediately before nap
- Caffeine takes 20 minutes to kick in
- Wake up as caffeine hits → double boost

**5. After waking:**
- Get up immediately (don't snooze)
- Bright light (turn on lights, go outside)
- Movement (walk, stretch)
- Splash face with cold water

---

### Common Nap Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Napping too long (60-90 minutes)**
- Enter deep sleep
- Wake up groggy (sleep inertia)
- Feel worse than before

**Fix:** Set alarm for 25 minutes max, or go for full 90 min if you have time (complete full cycle)

**Mistake 2: Napping too late (after 4pm)**
- Reduces sleep pressure for nighttime
- Harder to fall asleep at bedtime
- Disrupts sleep schedule

**Fix:** Naps before 3pm only

**Mistake 3: Napping in uncomfortable position**
- Sitting upright at desk
- Quality of rest is poor
- Wake up with neck pain

**Fix:** Lie down if possible, even on floor with cushion

## Gap Effects: 10-Second Micro-Breaks During Practice

**The discovery (Dr. Andrew Huberman's lab):**

During skill practice or learning, **brief pauses (gaps) dramatically enhance retention.**

### What Happens During Gaps

**The study:**
- Participants learned a motor skill (typing sequence)
- Some took 10-second breaks between practice attempts
- Others practiced continuously

**During the 10-second gaps:**
- Brain activity was recorded
- The brain REPLAYED the skill at **20x speed**
- This replay occurred during wakeful rest (not sleep)

**Result:**
- Group with gaps: 2x improvement in retention
- Group without gaps: Normal learning curve

**The insight:** Your brain needs micro-pauses to consolidate what you just practiced.

---

### How to Implement Gap Effects

**For procedural learning (math, coding, problem-solving):**

**Traditional approach:**
- Solve 10 problems in a row without stopping

**Gap-enhanced approach:**
- Solve 1 problem
- 10-second pause (close eyes, do nothing, let brain replay)
- Solve next problem
- 10-second pause
- Repeat

**Result:** Better retention, stronger understanding

---

**For concept learning (reading, lecture review):**

**Traditional approach:**
- Read chapter straight through

**Gap-enhanced approach:**
- Read one section (5-10 minutes)
- 10-second pause (close eyes, let it sink in)
- Read next section
- 10-second pause
- Repeat

**Result:** Better comprehension, easier recall later

---

**For flashcard review:**

**Traditional approach:**
- Flip through 50 cards as fast as possible

**Gap-enhanced approach:**
- Review 5 cards
- 10-second pause
- Review next 5 cards
- 10-second pause
- Repeat

**Result:** Stronger memory formation

---

### The Random Buzzer Method

**The problem:** You forget to take the 10-second pauses (you get into flow and keep going).

**The solution:** Random timer app

**How it works:**
1. Set a timer to buzz randomly every 2-5 minutes (variable interval)
2. When it buzzes: STOP whatever you're doing
3. Close your eyes for 10 seconds (do nothing, just rest)
4. Resume

**Apps that do this:**
- Randomly RemindMe (iOS)
- Random Reminder (Android)
- Or use Pomodoro timer with shorter intervals (5 min work, 10 sec pause)

**Why random intervals work better:**
- Your brain doesn't anticipate the break
- Forces genuine pauses (not just at convenient stopping points)
- More closely mimics natural attention rhythms

---

## Breaks BETWEEN Study Sessions (Not Just During)

**Most students think: "I'll take a break after I finish this chapter."**

**Better: "I'll take a break TO ENHANCE learning."**

### The Between-Session Break Protocol

**After a focused study session (45-90 minutes):**

**1. Immediate micro-break (5 minutes):**
- Stand up, stretch
- Eyes off screen (look at distance)
- Drink water
- Don't check phone (still allowing consolidation)

**2. Active break (10-20 minutes):**
- Walk outside (ideal)
- Light exercise (yoga, stretching, bodyweight exercises)
- Social interaction (chat with friend)
- Creative activity (doodle, play instrument for fun)

**3. What to AVOID:**
- More studying (defeats the purpose)
- Passive screen time (scrolling social media)
- Email/messages (keeps brain in task mode)
- Stressful activities (news, arguments)

---

### Why Active Breaks Work Better Than Passive

**Passive break:**
- Sit on couch, scroll phone
- Brain stays in same state (screen attention)
- Physical body still sedentary
- Mental fatigue persists

**Active break:**
- Movement increases blood flow to brain
- Change of environment resets attention
- Physical activity releases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) → enhances learning
- Return to studying with fresh perspective

**The data:**
- 10-minute walk improves focus for next 60 minutes
- 10-minute phone scroll has no effect on focus (sometimes decreases it)

---

## What to Avoid During Breaks

**The productivity paradox: Not all breaks are restorative.**

### 1. Social Media and Infinite Scroll

**The trap:**
- "I'll just check Instagram for 5 minutes"
- Algorithm is designed to keep you scrolling
- 5 minutes becomes 30 minutes

**Why it's bad:**
- Doesn't restore focus (fragments it further)
- Emotional up-and-down from content (drains energy)
- Hard to stop (dopamine loop)
- Return to studying feeling worse, not better

**The fix:**
- Phone in another room during study sessions
- If you must check, set a timer (5 min), use app blocker to enforce
- Better: Replace with movement or real social interaction

---

### 2. Email and Messages

**The trap:**
- "I'll just respond to this one email during my break"
- Email requires decision-making and context-switching
- Triggers stress (new obligations, reminders of other tasks)

**Why it's bad:**
- Doesn't give your brain a rest (still in work mode)
- Often reveals new problems that distract you from studying
- Emotional burden carries into next study session

**The fix:**
- Schedule specific times for email (not during study breaks)
- Airplane mode during study sessions and breaks
- Batch communication for end of day

---

### 3. Another Cognitively Demanding Task

**The trap:**
- Take a "break" from biology by doing chemistry homework
- Think you're being productive with your time

**Why it's bad:**
- Not a break—just task-switching
- Cognitive fatigue continues to build
- No consolidation happens (brain is still in work mode)

**The fix:**
- Breaks are for REST, not different work
- If you want to switch subjects, schedule it as a separate study block (not a break)

---

### 4. Stressful Content (News, Arguments)

**The trap:**
- Check news during break
- See something upsetting or anxiety-inducing
- Get into an argument via text

**Why it's bad:**
- Stress hormones (cortisol) spike
- Emotional regulation required (drains willpower)
- Return to studying in worse emotional state
- Harder to focus when stressed

**The fix:**
- Avoid news during study days (check once at end of day if needed)
- Don't engage in difficult conversations during study breaks
- Save emotional processing for after study session

---

## Building a Break Strategy That Works for YOU

**Not everyone recovers the same way. Experiment.**

### Week 1: Test Different Break Activities

**Try each for 2-3 breaks, track how you feel after:**

**Option A: Walking break**
- 10 min walk outside
- Track: Energy level before/after, focus quality when returning to study

**Option B: Movement break**
- 10 min stretching, yoga, or bodyweight exercises
- Track: Same as above

**Option C: Social break**
- 10 min chat with friend/roommate
- Track: Same as above

**Option D: Mindfulness break**
- 10 min meditation or breathing
- Track: Same as above

**Option E: Creative break**
- 10 min doodling, music, journaling
- Track: Same as above

**Option F: NSDR break**
- 10-20 min guided NSDR
- Track: Same as above

---

### Week 2: Identify Your Best Break Types

**Review your tracking:**
- Which break types left you most refreshed?
- Which ones you actually enjoyed (sustainability matters)?
- Which ones fit your environment and schedule?

**Create your personalized break menu:**
- **Primary break (highest restoration):** Walking outside
- **Backup break (when can't go outside):** Stretching routine
- **Quick break (between Pomodoros):** 10 deep breaths at window
- **Long break (after 2-3 hours):** 20-min NSDR session

---

### Week 3+: Implement Consistently

**Build breaks into your schedule:**

**Example study session structure:**
```
2:00pm - 2:50pm: Study block (Biology)
2:50pm - 3:00pm: 10-min break (Walk outside)
3:00pm - 3:50pm: Study block (Chemistry)
3:50pm - 4:00pm: 10-min break (Stretching)
4:00pm - 4:50pm: Study block (Biology retrieval practice)
4:50pm - 5:20pm: 30-min long break (NSDR session)
```

**The principle:** Breaks are SCHEDULED, not optional.

---

## The Forgotten Break: Sleep

**The ultimate break is sleep. Don't negotiate on this.**

### Why 7-9 Hours Is Non-Negotiable

**During sleep:**
- Memory consolidation (short-term → long-term)
- Neural pruning (removing unnecessary connections)
- Emotional processing (reducing stress from the day)
- Metabolic waste removal (glymphatic system clears brain)
- Hormone regulation (growth hormone, cortisol reset)

**Without adequate sleep:**
- Learning capacity drops by 40%
- Memory formation impaired
- Emotional regulation fails (more anxiety, irritability)
- Physical health suffers (immune system, metabolism)

**You cannot "catch up" on sleep debt effectively.** Chronic sleep deprivation has cumulative effects.

---

### Sleep Optimization Basics

**1. Consistent schedule:**
- Same bedtime and wake time every day (yes, weekends too)
- Builds strong circadian rhythm

**2. Sleep environment:**
- Dark (blackout curtains or eye mask)
- Cool (65-68°F ideal)
- Quiet (earplugs or white noise)

**3. Pre-sleep routine:**
- No screens 60 min before bed (blue light suppresses melatonin)
- Dim lights in evening
- Wind-down activities (reading, stretching, journaling)

**4. Avoid:**
- Caffeine after 2pm (half-life is 5-6 hours)
- Large meals before bed
- Intense exercise within 3 hours of bedtime
- Alcohol (disrupts sleep architecture)

## LLM-ACTIONABLE-INSIGHTS: Break Optimization

*This section provides structured prompts for AI assistants to help students design effective break strategies.*

---

### PROMPT 1: Design My Personalized Break Protocol

**LLM prompt**:
```
Help me design a break strategy that actually works for me.

My study pattern:
- Typical study session length: [45 min, 90 min, etc.]
- Study location: [dorm, library, coffee shop, etc.]
- Study schedule: [when I usually study]

My constraints:
- Environment: [what's possible - can I go outside? private space?]
- Time: [how much break time I can afford]
- Energy issues: [do I get eye strain? back pain? mental fog?]

My preferences:
- Activities I enjoy: [movement, social, creative, quiet, etc.]

Design a break protocol:
1. MICRO-BREAKS (during study session, every X minutes)
   - What to do, how long, what to avoid
2. SESSION BREAKS (between study sessions)
   - What to do, how long, best activities for my situation
3. LONG BREAKS (after 3+ hours of work)
   - What to do, how long, recovery focus
4. DAILY RECOVERY (end of study day)
   - Wind-down protocol, prep for next day

Be specific and realistic for my situation.
```

---

### PROMPT 2: Fix My Current Break Habits

**LLM prompt**:
```
My current break habits aren't working. Here's what I do:

CURRENT BREAK ROUTINE:

Make it easy to start TODAY.
```

---

### PROMPT 4: Optimize My Sleep for Learning

**LLM prompt**:
```
I know sleep is important but I'm not prioritizing it. Help me fix this.

Current sleep:
- Hours per night: [average]
- Bedtime: [when I actually go to bed]
- Wake time: [when I wake up]
- Quality: [how I feel - groggy, refreshed, tired, etc.]

Obstacles to good sleep:
- [Late assignments, social life, can't fall asleep, etc.]

My constraints:
- Class schedule: [earliest class time]
- Other commitments: [work, activities, etc.]

Design a sleep optimization plan:
1. Realistic sleep schedule (bedtime and wake time that fits my life)
2. Pre-sleep routine (60 min before bed, step by step)
3. Environment improvements (specific changes to my room)
4. Habit changes (what to stop doing, what to start doing)
5. Transition plan (how to shift from current schedule to better one)
6. Backup strategies (for nights when I can't sleep or must stay up)

Focus on SUSTAINABLE changes, not perfection.
```

---

### PROMPT 5: Design Break Activities for My Environment

**LLM prompt**:
```
I need break ideas that work in my specific environment.

Where I study:
- [Library, dorm room, coffee shop, etc.]

What's available:
- [Outside space? Private room? Gym access? etc.]

What's realistic:
- [Time available for breaks, noise level, privacy, etc.]

Constraints:
- [Can't be loud, can't leave building, etc.]

Generate break activity menu:
1. MOVEMENT breaks (that work in my environment)
2. MENTAL REST breaks (suited to my space)
3. SOCIAL breaks (if applicable and available)
4. CREATIVE breaks (low-barrier activities)
5. ENVIRONMENT changes (how to improve my study space for breaks)

For each activity:
- Exact steps (what to do)
- Duration (how long)
- When to use it (which type of break)

Make it specific to MY situation, not generic advice.
```

---

### PROMPT 6: Implement Gap Effects in My Practice

**LLM prompt**:
```
I want to use gap effects (10-second micro-breaks) during practice.

What I'm learning:
- [Subject/skill: math, coding, language, etc.]
- [Type of practice: problem sets, flashcards, reading, etc.]

Current practice routine:
- [How I currently study this material]

Help me implement gap effects:
1. Where exactly to insert 10-second pauses (after each problem? each page?)
2. What to do during the pause (close eyes, look away, etc.)
3. How to remember to take the pauses (timer, random buzzer, etc.)
4. How to structure practice session (work/gap rhythm)
5. What to track (to see if it's helping)

Provide specific protocol I can follow TODAY.
```

---

### PROMPT 7: Balance Study Time and Break Time

**LLM prompt**:
```
I'm not sure if I'm taking too many or too few breaks.

My current pattern:
- Study blocks: [length, e.g., 2 hours straight]
- Breaks: [frequency and length]
- Total study time per day: [hours]

How I feel:
- [Burnout, can't focus, feel like I'm wasting time, etc.]

My goals:
- [Study X hours/day, maintain focus, avoid burnout, etc.]

Help me find the right balance:
1. Is my current study/break ratio appropriate? (based on research)
2. Recommended work/break structure (for my goals and capacity)
3. Signs I'm taking too few breaks (what to watch for)
4. Signs I'm taking too many breaks (what to watch for)
5. Experiment to run (test different ratios, track results)

Give me a data-driven approach to finding MY optimal balance.
```

---

### PROMPT 8: Design Recovery Breaks for Exam Week

**LLM prompt**:
```
It's exam week. I'm studying intensely. How do I take breaks that actually help?

Exam schedule:
- [List exams and dates]

Study volume:
- [Hours per day I'm studying]

Current state:
- [Stress level, fatigue, sleep, etc.]

Constraints:
- [Limited time, can't take long breaks, etc.]

Design high-leverage breaks for exam week:
1. MINIMUM breaks I must take (non-negotiable for functioning)
2. STRATEGIC breaks (maximize recovery in minimal time)
3. EMERGENCY recovery (if I'm crashing mid-day)
4. SLEEP protocol (ensure enough rest despite pressure)
5. What to AVOID (break activities that will hurt, not help)

Focus on efficiency—maximum recovery in minimum time.
```

---

### FRAMEWORK: Break Activity Decision Matrix

**For LLM to recommend appropriate breaks**:

```
BREAK LENGTH DETERMINES ACTIVITY:

MICRO-BREAK (10 seconds - 2 minutes):
→ Close eyes, deep breaths
→ Look at distance (20-20-20 rule: every 20 min, look 20 feet away for 20 sec)
→ Stand and stretch
→ Drink water

SHORT BREAK (5-10 minutes):
→ Walk (inside or outside)
→ Light stretching routine
→ Bathroom + water + snack
→ Chat with friend (brief)
→ Step outside for fresh air

MEDIUM BREAK (15-30 minutes):
→ Walk outside (ideal)
→ NSDR session
→ Power nap (20 min)
→ Light exercise (yoga, bodyweight)
→ Eat a meal (small)
→ Social interaction

LONG BREAK (45-90 minutes):
→ Full NSDR session
→ Complete nap cycle (90 min)
→ Meal + walk
→ Exercise session
→ Major context switch (different activity entirely)

BREAK TIMING MATTERS:

DURING study session (every 25-50 min):
→ Micro or short break
→ Purpose: Maintain focus, prevent fatigue

BETWEEN study sessions (after 90-120 min):
→ Medium break
→ Purpose: Consolidation, genuine rest

AFTER intensive study block (3+ hours):
→ Long break
→ Purpose: Deep recovery, prevent burnout

END of study day:
→ Extended break (rest of evening)
→ Purpose: Wind down, prepare for sleep
```

---

### INTEGRATION: Breaks + Other Productivity Systems

**LLM can suggest combinations**:

**Breaks + Pomodoro**:
```
25-min work → 5-min break (short: walk, stretch)
After 4 Pomodoros → 15-min break (medium: NSDR, walk outside)
```

**Breaks + Time-Blocking**:
```
Block study time + break time together:
2:00-2:50pm: Study
2:50-3:00pm: Break (scheduled, non-negotiable)
3:00-3:50pm: Study
```

**Breaks + Peak Productivity Windows**:
```
Schedule breaks AROUND peaks, not during:
- Peak window (9am-12pm): Minimize breaks, maximize focus
- Post-peak (12pm-1pm): LONGER break (meal + walk)
- Secondary work (2pm-4pm): Normal break schedule
```

**Breaks + Gap Effects**:
```
Within study session:
- Every 5 min of practice → 10-sec gap (micro-break)
- Every 50 min of work → 10-min break (short break)
```

---

### USAGE NOTES FOR LLMs

When helping students optimize breaks:

1. **Breaks are mandatory, not optional** - emphasize this
2. **Active breaks > passive breaks** - movement almost always wins
3. **Phone scrolling is NOT a break** - warn against this explicitly
4. **Sleep is the ultimate break** - don't let students sacrifice this
5. **NSDR is powerful but underutilized** - introduce it with specific resources
6. **Individual variation matters** - what restores one person may not work for another
7. **Environment constrains options** - design around student's actual situation
8. **Consistency matters more than perfection** - small, regular breaks > occasional long ones
9. **Track and iterate** - students should experiment to find what works
10. **Break timing affects learning** - gaps between practice enhance consolidation
