# Implementation Intentions: The Science of Specificity

## Overview

Implementation intentions are a highly effective behavioral strategy developed by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer in the 1990s. They involve pre-deciding when, where, and how you will act. By being specific about the circumstances of your behavior, you dramatically increase the likelihood of follow-through. This simple technique has been validated by hundreds of studies and is one of the most reliable methods for turning intentions into action.

## Research Basis: Peter Gollwitzer's Discovery

### The Problem Gollwitzer Identified

**The intention-behavior gap**: People frequently fail to act on their goals despite strong intentions.

**Common scenario**:
- Person: "I'm going to exercise more"
- Reality: Weeks pass, no exercise happens
- Not a motivation problem - a specification problem

### The Breakthrough: If-Then Planning

**Year**: 1999
**Lead researcher**: Peter Gollwitzer, NYU
**Key insight**: Vague goals fail; specific plans succeed

**Research methodology**:
- Compare general goal intentions: "I intend to exercise"
- Against implementation intentions: "I will exercise at 7 AM on Monday in my living room"
- Measure actual behavior change

**Results**: Implementation intentions increased goal achievement rates by 2-3x across hundreds of studies

### Meta-Analysis Evidence

**Gollwitzer & Sheeran (2006)**: Meta-analysis of 94 studies

**Findings**:
- Medium-to-large effect size (d = 0.65)
- Effective across diverse domains: health, academics, relationships, consumer behavior
- Effective across populations: students, employees, patients, elderly
- Benefits both simple and complex behaviors

**Key statistic**: Implementation intentions improved goal attainment by an average of 20-30 percentage points

### Why It Works: The Psychological Mechanism

**Automatic activation**: Pre-deciding when and where to act creates automatic behavioral triggering

**Process**:
1. You specify critical situation: "at 7 AM" / "in the kitchen" / "when I feel stressed"
2. Situation gets encoded in memory with high accessibility
3. When situation occurs, attention automatically drawn to it
4. Behavior is triggered without need for further deliberation
5. No willpower required in the moment

**Gollwitzer's explanation**: "Implementation intentions delegate control of goal-directed behavior to situational cues, which then elicit that behavior automatically, without requiring conscious intent."

### Comparison to Goal Intentions

**Goal intention**:
- Format: "I intend to achieve X"
- Example: "I intend to exercise regularly"
- Mental process: Ends-focused, outcome-oriented
- Limitation: Doesn't specify how or when

**Implementation intention**:
- Format: "If/When situation Y arises, I will perform behavior Z"
- Example: "On Monday at 7 AM, I will do 20 pushups in my bedroom"
- Mental process: Means-focused, action-oriented
- Strength: Specifies exactly how and when

**Critical difference**: Implementation intentions forge a mental link between situation and action, creating an "instant habit" effect.

## The Formula: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"

### Three Essential Components

**1. BEHAVIOR (What)**
- The specific action you will take
- Must be concrete and measurable
- Single, clear behavior (not vague category)

**2. TIME (When)**
- Specific moment when behavior will occur
- Can be clock time or event-based trigger
- Creates temporal cue

**3. LOCATION (Where)**
- Physical place where behavior will happen
- Creates environmental cue
- Anchors behavior in space

### Why All Three Components Matter

**Behavior specificity**:
- Vague: "exercise" → What type? How long? How intense?
- Specific: "20 minutes on treadmill" → No ambiguity, clear action

**Time specificity**:
- Vague: "in the morning" → Could be 6 AM or 11 AM, easy to postpone
- Specific: "7:00 AM" → Precise trigger, no negotiation

**Location specificity**:
- Vague: "at home" → Living room? Bedroom? Garage?
- Specific: "in my home gym" → Exact environmental cue, removes decision

**Combined power**: Three specifications create a unique "situational signature" that automatically triggers behavior.

### Formula Variations

**Standard format**:
"I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"

**Alternative formats** (all effective):
- "At [TIME] in [LOCATION], I will [BEHAVIOR]"
- "When I am in [LOCATION] at [TIME], I will [BEHAVIOR]"
- "This [DAY] at [TIME], I will [BEHAVIOR] in [LOCATION]"

**If-then format**:
"If/When [SITUATION], then I will [BEHAVIOR]"

**Example**: "If I feel stressed, then I will take three deep breaths"

### Examples Across Domains

**Exercise**:
- "I will run for 30 minutes at 6:30 AM on the trail near my house"
- "I will do yoga at 7 PM in my living room on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays"
- "I will do 50 pushups at 12 PM in my office every weekday"

**Nutrition**:
- "I will eat a serving of vegetables at 6 PM at the dinner table every night"
- "I will drink a full glass of water at 7 AM in my kitchen before coffee"
- "I will pack a healthy lunch at 9 PM in my kitchen every Sunday"

**Learning**:
- "I will study Spanish for 20 minutes at 8 PM in my bedroom every night"
- "I will read one chapter at 10 PM in bed before sleep"
- "I will practice piano for 15 minutes at 5 PM in my music room on weekdays"

**Relationships**:
- "I will call my parents at 2 PM on Sunday in my living room"
- "I will have a date night at 7 PM on Friday at a local restaurant"
- "I will ask my partner three questions about their day at 6:30 PM at the dinner table"

**Work/Productivity**:
- "I will work on my priority project from 9-11 AM in my office with door closed"
- "I will review my weekly goals at 4 PM on Friday in my workspace"
- "I will clear my inbox at 2 PM in my office every day"

**Mental Health**:
- "I will meditate for 10 minutes at 6 AM in my bedroom corner every morning"
- "I will journal for 5 minutes at 9 PM at my desk every night"
- "I will practice gratitude at 8 PM in bed before sleep"

**Financial**:
- "I will review my spending at 7 PM on Sunday at my desk"
- "I will transfer $50 to savings at 9 AM on the 1st of each month at my computer"
- "I will check my investment accounts at 10 AM on the first Saturday of each month"

## Why Specificity Dramatically Increases Follow-Through

### The Cognitive Psychology of Specificity

**Mental clarity eliminates decision fatigue**

**Vague intention scenario**:
1. "I should exercise more"
2. Moment arises: "Should I exercise now? What kind? How long? Where? Do I have time?"
3. Too many decisions → paralysis or postponement
4. Result: No action

**Specific intention scenario**:
1. "I will run for 20 minutes at 6 AM on the park trail"
2. 6 AM arrives: Alarm goes off
3. No decisions needed, just execute pre-made plan
4. Result: Action occurs

**Key principle**: Specificity moves decision-making from the moment of action (when willpower is required) to a planning session (when willpower is high).

### Reducing Cognitive Load

**Working memory limitations**:
- Can only hold 4-7 items consciously at once
- Every decision consumes mental bandwidth
- Vague goals require constant re-decision

**Specificity as cognitive offloading**:
- Decisions pre-made and stored in long-term memory
- Situational cues automatically retrieve the plan
- No working memory consumed in the moment

**Energy conservation**: Specific plans are mentally efficient; vague plans are mentally expensive.

### Eliminating Ambiguity

**The interpretation problem with vague goals**:

**Vague**: "I'll eat healthier"
- Does pizza with vegetables count?
- Is eating healthy 80% of the time enough?
- Does "healthier" mean low-carb, low-fat, whole foods?

**Specific**: "I will eat 2 servings of vegetables at 6 PM with dinner"
- No interpretation needed
- Binary: either did it or didn't
- Clear success criteria

**Clarity drives action**: When you know exactly what to do, you're far more likely to do it.

### Creating Psychological Commitment

**Zeigarnik Effect**: Incomplete specific plans create mental tension that drives completion.

**Mechanism**:
1. You form specific implementation intention
2. Brain encodes it as an "open loop" to be completed
3. When specified time/location arrives, brain signals: "You said you'd do this now"
4. Psychological pressure to complete and close the loop

**Vague intentions don't create this pressure**: "Exercise sometime" creates no open loop because there's no specific condition that signals incompletion.

### Reducing Ego Depletion

**Ego depletion theory**: Self-control is a limited resource that depletes with use.

**How vague goals deplete willpower**:
- Each moment throughout day: "Should I do my goal now?"
- Each instance consumes willpower
- By evening, willpower exhausted
- Goal not achieved

**How specific intentions preserve willpower**:
- Decision made once during planning
- No repeated decisions throughout day
- Willpower preserved
- When specified moment arrives, plan executes automatically

**Research finding** (Gollwitzer): People with implementation intentions show less ego depletion than those with goal intentions alone.

## Hundreds of Studies Showing Effectiveness

### Health Behaviors

**Study 1: Cervical cancer screening** (Sheeran & Orbell, 2000)
- **Intervention**: Women asked to write when and where they would attend screening
- **Results**: 92% attended vs. 69% in control group
- **Effect size**: 23 percentage point increase

**Study 2: Vitamin supplementation** (Sheeran & Orbell, 1999)
- **Intervention**: Participants specified when and where they'd take vitamins
- **Results**: Took vitamins more consistently (mean = 4.2 vs. 2.9 times per week)
- **Persistence**: Effect maintained over 3 weeks

**Study 3: Exercise behavior** (Milne et al., 2002)
- **Sample**: 248 adults
- **Intervention**: "I will exercise for at least 20 minutes on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE]"
- **Results**: 91% exercised at least once per week vs. 38% in control
- **Magnitude**: 2.4x increase in exercise behavior

**Study 4: Breast self-examination** (Orbell et al., 1997)
- **Intervention**: Specify when and where to perform exam
- **Results**: 100% performed exam vs. 53% in control
- **Follow-up**: Effect maintained at 1-month follow-up

### Academic Performance

**Study 5: Test preparation** (Gollwitzer & Brandstätter, 1997)
- **Context**: University students with holiday break assignment
- **Intervention**: Specify exactly when and where they'd write essay during break
- **Results**: 75% completed vs. 33% in control group
- **Notable**: Control group had same motivation, different execution plan

**Study 6: Study behavior** (Duckworth et al., 2011)
- **Sample**: High school students
- **Intervention**: Implementation intentions for study sessions
- **Results**: Higher GPA and standardized test scores
- **Mechanism**: More consistent study behavior

### Breaking Unwanted Habits

**Study 7: Reducing unhealthy snacking** (Adriaanse et al., 2011)
- **Intervention**: "If I want a snack, then I will eat fruit" + specify when/where
- **Results**: Reduced unhealthy snacking, increased fruit consumption
- **Key**: Replacement behavior specified, not just suppression

**Study 8: Reducing excessive drinking** (Armitage, 2009)
- **Intervention**: Specify alternative behaviors when drinking cues arise
- **Results**: Reduced alcohol consumption in binge drinkers
- **Follow-up**: Effects maintained at 1-month follow-up

### Clinical Populations

**Study 9: Goal achievement in depression** (Pember, 2014)
- **Sample**: Individuals with clinical depression
- **Finding**: Implementation intentions helped overcome motivational deficits
- **Implication**: Specificity compensates for low motivation

**Study 10: Recovery from brain injury** (Lengfelder & Gollwitzer, 2001)
- **Sample**: Frontal lobe patients (impaired self-regulation)
- **Finding**: Implementation intentions improved goal achievement
- **Significance**: Automatic cueing bypasses need for executive function

### Diversity of Domains

**Meta-analysis summary** (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006):

Implementation intentions have proven effective across:
- Health: screening, medication adherence, safe sex, addiction recovery
- Achievement: academic goals, athletic performance, skill acquisition
- Environmental: recycling, public transportation use, conservation
- Consumer: saving money, avoiding impulse purchases
- Social: initiating conversations, maintaining relationships, helping others
- Emotional: regulating negative emotions, increasing positive affect

**Universal principle**: When you specify when, where, and how you'll act, you're 2-3x more likely to actually do it.

## How Vague Intentions Fail

### The Failure Pattern

**Common vague intentions**:
- "I'll exercise more"
- "I'll eat healthier"
- "I'll be more productive"
- "I'll spend more time with family"
- "I'll save more money"
- "I'll learn a new skill"

**Why they fail**:

### Failure Point 1: No Clear Starting Cue

**Problem**: You never know exactly when to start.

**Example**:
- Intention: "I'll exercise more"
- Monday morning: "Should I exercise now? Or after breakfast? Or maybe this afternoon?"
- Afternoon: "I'll do it tonight"
- Night: "I'm too tired now, tomorrow for sure"
- Result: Day ends, no exercise

**Missing element**: No specific time that says "Do it NOW"

### Failure Point 2: Infinite Postponement

**Problem**: Can always be done "later" because no specific time was set.

**Example**:
- Intention: "I'll call my parents more often"
- Every day: "I should call them... but I'm busy now, I'll do it later"
- Week passes: Still haven't called
- Guilt accumulates but behavior doesn't change

**Missing element**: No defined moment that creates obligation

### Failure Point 3: Ambiguous Success Criteria

**Problem**: You don't know if you've succeeded or failed.

**Example**:
- Intention: "I'll eat healthier"
- You eat a salad for lunch but pizza for dinner
- Did you succeed? Partially? Does it count?
- Ambiguity prevents learning and improvement

**Missing element**: Clear, measurable behavior that's either done or not done

### Failure Point 4: Decision Fatigue in the Moment

**Problem**: Having to re-decide in the moment when willpower is low.

**Example**:
- Intention: "I'll be more productive"
- Sitting at desk: "What should I work on? Email? That project? Maybe clear some small tasks first..."
- 30 minutes passes deciding, procrastinating, getting distracted
- End of day: Wasn't very productive

**Missing element**: Pre-made decision about specific task at specific time

### Failure Point 5: No Environmental Cues

**Problem**: Nothing in your environment reminds you to do the behavior.

**Example**:
- Intention: "I'll meditate regularly"
- Days go by without meditation because nothing triggers the thought
- Occasionally remember but at inconvenient times
- Meditation doesn't become routine

**Missing element**: Specific location that serves as environmental trigger

### Failure Point 6: Competes Poorly with Immediate Gratification

**Problem**: Vague future intention loses to specific present temptation.

**Example**:
- Vague intention: "I'll eat healthier"
- Specific temptation: Fresh cookies right here, right now
- Result: Cookies win because they're specific and immediate

**Contrast**:
- Specific intention: "At 3 PM I eat my pre-portioned apple slices at my desk"
- Specific temptation: Cookies in break room
- Result: Implementation intention has fighting chance because it's equally specific

### The "Someday" Trap

**Vague intentions live in "someday"**:
- "Someday I'll exercise more"
- "Someday I'll learn Spanish"
- "Someday I'll write that book"

**Someday = Never**:
- No specific day is "someday"
- Always gets pushed to tomorrow
- Years pass without action

**Specific intentions live in "today"**:
- "Today at 6:30 AM I will run"
- "Today at 8 PM I will study Spanish for 15 minutes"
- "Today at 5 PM I will write for 30 minutes"

**Today = Now**: Creates urgency and action

## Time and Location as Powerful Cues

### Time as a Trigger

**Why time works**:
- Specific moment creates automatic mental alarm
- Brain tracks time unconsciously
- External cues (clocks, alarms, schedule transitions) reinforce
- Cultural time structures provide natural anchors

**Types of time-based cues**:

**1. Clock time**
- "At 7:00 AM I will..."
- Precise, unambiguous
- Can set actual alarms as support
- Works best for daily habits

**2. Relative time**
- "20 minutes after I wake up, I will..."
- "Right before lunch, I will..."
- Flexible while still specific
- Works well when schedule varies

**3. Time blocks**
- "Between 9-10 AM I will..."
- Provides window while maintaining specificity
- Good for longer or variable-duration activities

**4. Schedule-based time**
- "Right after my last class on Tuesday, I will..."
- "During my lunch break at noon, I will..."
- Anchors to existing schedule structure

**Effectiveness ranking**:
1. Exact clock time + alarm (most effective)
2. Relative time from existing habit
3. Time blocks
4. Vague time periods (least effective)

### Location as a Trigger

**Why location works**:
- Environment shapes behavior powerfully
- Visual cues automatically direct attention
- Context-dependent memory: behaviors associated with locations
- Spatial anchors are processed pre-consciously

**Types of location-based cues**:

**1. Specific room**
- "In my bedroom I will..."
- "In the gym I will..."
- Room context primes associated behaviors

**2. Specific spot within room**
- "At my desk in my home office I will..."
- "On my yoga mat in the corner of my bedroom I will..."
- Even more specific context, stronger cue

**3. Transition locations**
- "At the doorway when I leave, I will..."
- "In the car when I arrive at work, I will..."
- Leverages threshold moments

**4. Journey anchors**
- "On the path to work I will..."
- "While walking the dog I will..."
- Uses movement through space as cue

**Environmental preparation**:
- Place items needed in the specified location
- Visual cues in the location (notes, equipment visible)
- Arrange location to minimize friction

### Combining Time + Location: Maximum Effectiveness

**Why combination is powerful**:
- Creates unique "situational signature"
- Two independent cues increase noticing
- Redundancy ensures you won't miss the moment
- Constrains possibilities: specific time AND place

**Examples**:
- "At 7 AM in my kitchen, I will drink a green smoothie"
- "At noon in the office gym, I will lift weights for 30 minutes"
- "At 9 PM at my desk, I will journal for 10 minutes"

**Research finding**: Time + location together produce stronger effects than either alone.

### Natural Time-Location Pairs

**Identify existing anchors in your life**:

**Morning anchors**:
- Time: 6-9 AM
- Location: Bedroom, bathroom, kitchen
- Natural behaviors: Waking, showering, breakfast

**Workday anchors**:
- Time: 9-5 PM
- Location: Office, desk, meeting rooms
- Natural behaviors: Starting work, lunch break, end of day

**Evening anchors**:
- Time: 6-10 PM
- Location: Kitchen, living room, bedroom
- Natural behaviors: Dinner, relaxation, bedtime prep

**Weekend anchors**:
- Time: More flexible but can still specify
- Location: Home, outdoors, social venues
- Natural behaviors: Errands, leisure, family time

**Strategy**: Map your new habits onto existing time-location anchors.

## Combining Implementation Intentions with Habit Stacking for Maximum Effect

### Two Powerful Techniques United

**Implementation intentions**:
- Format: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"
- Strength: Uses time and place as cues

**Habit stacking**:
- Format: "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]"
- Strength: Uses existing behavior as cue

**Combined approach**:
- Format: "After [CURRENT HABIT] at [TIME] in [LOCATION], I will [NEW HABIT]"
- Strength: Three independent cues (behavior, time, location)

### Why Combination Amplifies Effectiveness

**Triple redundancy**:
- Behavioral cue: Completion of existing habit
- Temporal cue: Specific time
- Spatial cue: Specific location

**Increased noticing**: Very hard to miss the moment when three cues align

**Clearer specification**: Maximally removes ambiguity

**Leverages multiple memory systems**:
- Procedural memory (habit completion)
- Temporal memory (time awareness)
- Spatial memory (location awareness)

### Combined Format Examples

**Basic combination**:
"After I brush my teeth at 7:30 AM in my bathroom, I will floss"

**Components**:
- Current habit: Brush teeth
- Time: 7:30 AM
- Location: Bathroom
- New habit: Floss

**Why this works better than either alone**:
- Habit stacking alone: "After I brush teeth, I will floss" (what if you brush teeth at different times/places?)
- Implementation intention alone: "I will floss at 7:30 AM in my bathroom" (might forget without behavioral trigger)
- Combined: Three reminders pointing to same behavior

### More Examples

**Exercise example**:
"After I pour my coffee at 6 AM in my kitchen, I will do 10 pushups on the kitchen floor"
- Behavioral: Pouring coffee
- Temporal: 6 AM
- Spatial: Kitchen
- New behavior: 10 pushups

**Productivity example**:
"After I arrive at my desk at 9 AM in my office, I will write my top 3 priorities in my notebook"
- Behavioral: Arriving at desk
- Temporal: 9 AM
- Spatial: Office
- New behavior: Write priorities

**Learning example**:
"After I eat dinner at 7 PM at my dining table, I will study flashcards for 5 minutes"
- Behavioral: Finishing dinner
- Temporal: 7 PM
- Spatial: Dining table
- New behavior: Study flashcards

**Mindfulness example**:
"After I get into bed at 10 PM in my bedroom, I will do 10 deep breaths before sleep"
- Behavioral: Getting into bed
- Temporal: 10 PM
- Spatial: Bedroom
- New behavior: Deep breathing

### When to Use Combined Approach

**Best for**:
- Critical habits you absolutely want to establish
- Behaviors you've failed at with simpler approaches
- Habits requiring high consistency
- Times when your schedule is unpredictable (redundancy helps)

**Overkill for**:
- Already automatic behaviors
- Extremely simple habits
- Well-established routines

**Decision rule**: If a habit is important and you're struggling to build it, use the combined approach.

### Progressive Specificity Strategy

**Phase 1: Start with implementation intention**
"I will meditate at 7 AM in my bedroom"

**Phase 2: Add habit stacking if needed**
"After I make my bed at 7 AM in my bedroom, I will meditate for 2 minutes"

**Phase 3: Eventually simplify as habit becomes automatic**
"After I make my bed, I meditate" (time and location become implicit)

**Principle**: Use maximum specificity to establish habit, can simplify once automatic.

## Writing vs. Mental Implementation Intentions

### The Act of Writing

**Research finding**: Written implementation intentions are more effective than mental ones.

**Why writing enhances effectiveness**:

**1. Increased commitment**
- Written word feels more binding
- Creates psychological contract with self
- Physical artifact serves as external reminder

**2. Forced clarity**
- Must be precise enough to write down
- Ambiguity becomes obvious when putting pen to paper
- Refinement happens during writing process

**3. Better memory encoding**
- Motor memory (physical act of writing) aids retention
- Visual memory (seeing written words) reinforces
- More neural pathways activated than mental rehearsal alone

**4. External accountability**
- Can be shared with others
- Can be reviewed later
- Creates record to evaluate success

**Study evidence** (Nickerson & Rogers, 2010):
- Written implementation intentions: 78% completion rate
- Mental implementation intentions: 56% completion rate
- Control (goal intentions only): 34% completion rate

### How to Write Effective Implementation Intentions

**Format**:
```
I will [BEHAVIOR]
at [SPECIFIC TIME]
in [SPECIFIC LOCATION]
```

**Example**:
```
I will run for 20 minutes
at 6:30 AM
on the trail behind my house
```

**Where to write them**:

**Option 1: Habit journal**
- Dedicated notebook for habit tracking
- Write intention at top of page
- Track daily completion below

**Option 2: Index cards**
- One card per habit
- Place card in location where habit will occur
- Visual reminder in environment

**Option 3: Digital note**
- Phone note or app
- Calendar entry with reminder
- Easy to access and modify

**Option 4: Visible display**
- Post-it note in strategic location
- Whiteboard in workspace
- Mirror note for bathroom habits

**Best practice**: Write in present tense as if already committed, not future conditional ("I will" not "I might" or "I plan to")

### Mental Rehearsal as Complement

**Mental implementation intentions have value as supplement, not replacement**:

**Visualization practice**:
1. Close eyes
2. Imagine the specific time arriving
3. Picture the specific location
4. Visualize yourself performing the exact behavior
5. Imagine how it feels to complete it

**When to use mental rehearsal**:
- In addition to written intention (not instead of)
- Night before to pre-load intention
- During idle moments throughout day
- When approaching the specified time

**Research support** (Pham & Taylor, 1999):
- Mental simulation of implementation (the process) improved performance
- Mental simulation of outcome alone did not
- Process simulation = imagining yourself doing the specific behavior at specific time/place

### Verbal Declaration

**Speaking implementation intentions out loud**:

**Benefits**:
- Auditory memory encoding
- Increased sense of commitment
- Can involve others for accountability

**Techniques**:
- Say out loud when writing it down
- Declare to accountability partner
- Record yourself saying it
- Repeat it during transition to the specified location

**Daily reminder practice**:
- Each morning, say your implementation intentions out loud
- "Today at [TIME] in [LOCATION], I will [BEHAVIOR]"
- Primes intention for the day

### Comparison Summary

| Method | Effectiveness | Best Use Case |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Written | Highest | Primary method for all important habits |
| Mental + Written | Very High | Reinforcement of critical habits |
| Mental only | Moderate | Simple habits or supplement to written |
| Verbal declaration | High | Adding accountability dimension |
| Combination of all | Maximum | Most important or difficult habits |

**Recommendation**: Write it down. Add mental and verbal as boosters.

## LLM-ACTIONABLE-INSIGHTS

### For LLM Coaching Applications

**When guiding users to create implementation intentions**:

1. **Always push for the three specifications**:
   - "What EXACTLY will you do?"
   - "What TIME will you do it?"
   - "WHERE will you be when you do it?"

2. **Challenge vague language**:
   - User: "I'll exercise more"
   - LLM: "Let's make that specific. What type of exercise? For how long? At exactly what time? In what location?"

3. **Use fill-in-the-blank scaffolding**:
   ```
   I will _______________ [specific behavior]
   at _______________ [exact time]
   in _______________ [precise location]
   on _______________ [which days]
   ```

4. **Verify each component**:
   - "Is '7 AM' a time you can realistically do this every day?"
   - "Is your bedroom a good location for this, or would somewhere else work better?"
   - "Is 30 minutes the right duration, or should we start smaller?"

### Pattern Recognition

**Identify vague intentions in user statements**:
- "I want to..." → Implementation intention needed
- "I should..." → Implementation intention needed
- "I'll try to..." → Implementation intention needed
- "I need to... more" → Implementation intention needed

**Convert to specific**:
```
User: "I want to read more"
LLM: "Let's create an implementation intention.
- What will you read? Fiction, non-fiction, specific book?
- How much will you read? One page? One chapter? 20 minutes?
- When exactly? What time of day?
- Where will you be? In bed? At a desk? In a reading chair?"

User answers, then LLM creates:
"So your implementation intention is: 'I will read one chapter of [book] at 9:30 PM in my bed before sleep each night.' Does that feel specific and doable?"
```

### Coaching Dialogue Flow

**Step 1: Identify the goal**
```
LLM: "What habit are you trying to build?"
User: "I want to meditate regularly"
```

**Step 2: Specify the behavior**
```
LLM: "What does 'meditate' specifically mean for you? What will you actually do? For how long?"
User: "I guess 10 minutes of sitting meditation"
LLM: "Perfect. And what exactly will you do during those 10 minutes? Any specific technique?"
User: "Focus on my breath"
```

**Step 3: Specify the time**
```
LLM: "When during your day would this fit best? What exact time?"
User: "Probably in the morning"
LLM: "What specific time in the morning? 6 AM? 7 AM? 8 AM?"
User: "Probably 7 AM"
LLM: "Is 7 AM realistic for you every day? Including weekends?"
User: "Weekdays yes, weekends maybe 8 AM"
```

**Step 4: Specify the location**
```
LLM: "Where in your home will you meditate?"
User: "In my bedroom I guess"
LLM: "Where in your bedroom exactly? On your bed? On the floor? In a specific corner?"
User: "I have a corner by the window that would work"
```

**Step 5: Assemble and confirm**
```
LLM: "Great! Your implementation intention is: 'I will meditate for 10 minutes focusing on my breath at 7 AM (8 AM on weekends) in the corner by the window in my bedroom.'

Does that feel specific and realistic?"
```

**Step 6: Add writing commitment**
```
LLM: "Now, will you write this down? Research shows written implementation intentions are much more effective than mental ones. Where will you write it?"
```

### Troubleshooting Implementation Intentions

**User reports failure**:

**Diagnostic questions**:
1. "Did you write it down or just think about it?"
2. "Was the time realistic for your schedule?"
3. "Did you actually notice when the specified time arrived?"
4. "Was the location convenient?"
5. "Was the behavior too difficult or long?"

**Common issues and fixes**:

**Issue**: "I forgot to do it"
**Solution**: "Let's add an alarm or reminder at the specified time, and put a visual cue in the specified location"

**Issue**: "The time didn't work"
**Solution**: "Let's find a better time. Walk me through your typical day. Where's a natural gap?"

**Issue**: "The behavior felt too hard"
**Solution**: "Let's make it smaller. What's the tiniest version of this behavior you could do?"

**Issue**: "The location wasn't right"
**Solution**: "What location would be more convenient? Where are you already going to be at that time?"

### Enhancing with Habit Stacking

**When implementation intention alone isn't sufficient**:

```
LLM: "You have an implementation intention to meditate at 7 AM in your bedroom, but you're still forgetting. Let's add habit stacking. What do you already do at 7 AM in your bedroom every single day?"

User: "I make my bed"

LLM: "Perfect. Let's create a combined intention: 'After I make my bed at 7 AM in my bedroom, I will meditate for 10 minutes in my corner.' Now you have three cues: finishing making bed, 7 AM, and bedroom location. Much harder to miss."
```

### Evaluating User-Created Intentions

**Quality checklist for LLM to verify**:
- [ ] Behavior is specific and measurable (not vague)
- [ ] Time is exact (not "morning" or "evening")
- [ ] Location is precise (not just "home" or "work")
- [ ] Frequency is clear (daily, weekdays, specific days)
- [ ] Behavior is small enough to be doable consistently
- [ ] Time is realistic for user's schedule
- [ ] Location is where user will actually be at that time
- [ ] User has committed to writing it down

**If any box unchecked, prompt for more specificity**

### Generating Suggestions

**When user is stuck on time/location**:

**For time**:
```
LLM: "Let's find the right time. Think about your typical day:
- What time do you wake up?
- When do you eat breakfast/lunch/dinner?
- When do you commute?
- When do you start/end work?
- When do you go to bed?

Where could this habit fit naturally?"
```

**For location**:
```
LLM: "Let's identify a good location. Where do you spend time during your day?
- Which room at home do you use most?
- Do you have a dedicated workspace?
- Are there transition spaces (car, doorway) you pass through?
- Where do you already do similar activities?

Where would this habit fit most naturally?"
```

### Teaching Meta-Skill

**Help users learn to create their own implementation intentions**:

```
LLM: "You're getting good at this! You've now created specific implementation intentions for [X habits]. Notice the pattern?

Every time you want to build a habit, ask yourself:
1. What exactly will I do?
2. At what exact time?
3. In what exact location?

The more specific, the more likely you are to actually do it. This is a skill you can apply to any goal."
```

### Scaling Beyond Individual Habits

**For users with multiple goals**:

```
LLM: "You have several habits you want to build. Rather than create random implementation intentions, let's be strategic:

1. What times of day do you already have consistent routines?
2. What locations do you reliably be at each day?
3. How can we build implementation intentions that cluster together?

For example:
- Morning cluster: 6-8 AM, bedroom/kitchen
- Midday cluster: 12-1 PM, office/park
- Evening cluster: 8-10 PM, home office/bedroom

This way your implementation intentions reinforce each other."
```

### Measuring Success

**Track and evaluate**:

```
LLM: "You created this implementation intention 2 weeks ago. Let's evaluate:
- How many days out of 14 did you complete it?
- When you missed it, what happened? Forgot? Time didn't work? Location issue?
- When you succeeded, what made it work?
- Do we need to adjust anything, or is it working well?"
```

**Success metrics**:
- Days completed / Total days
- Trend over time (improving, stable, declining)
- User-reported ease (getting easier or still difficult)
- Whether it's becoming automatic

### Advanced Applications

**For complex habits**:
```
LLM: "This habit has multiple steps. Let's create implementation intentions for each critical point:

1. Starting: 'I will begin [habit] at [time] in [location]'
2. Continuing: 'If I get interrupted, I will return to [habit] immediately'
3. Completing: 'I will finish [habit] by [end time] in [location]'

This covers the full behavior cycle."
```

**For breaking bad habits**:
```
LLM: "To break this habit, we need a replacement implementation intention:

Old behavior: [Bad habit] in [situation]
New behavior: 'When [situation], I will [replacement] instead'

Example: 'When I feel stressed at 3 PM at my desk, I will take a 5-minute walk outside instead of scrolling social media.'

What trigger situation usually precedes your unwanted behavior?"
```
