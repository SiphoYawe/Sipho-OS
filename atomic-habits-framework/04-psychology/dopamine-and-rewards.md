# Dopamine and Rewards

## Overview

Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that drives habit formation, motivation, and desire. Understanding how dopamine works is fundamental to designing effective habits and understanding why certain behaviors become addictive while others feel effortful.

**Key Paradigm Shift**: Dopamine is released primarily during ANTICIPATION of reward, not during the reward itself. This fundamental insight explains why craving is more powerful than satisfaction, and why habits can be engineered through strategic dopamine manipulation.

## Core Mechanisms

### 1. Dopamine's Role in Habit Formation

**Primary Function**: Dopamine is not a "pleasure chemical" - it's a "motivation and prediction chemical"

**Core Functions**:
- **Wanting System**: Drives seeking behavior and motivation
- **Learning Signal**: Marks experiences as worthy of repetition
- **Prediction Engine**: Updates expectations based on outcomes
- **Energy Mobilizer**: Provides motivation to pursue goals

**The Habit Loop Connection**:
```
CUE → Dopamine Spike (Anticipation) → CRAVING → RESPONSE → REWARD → Dopamine Drop
```

**Critical Insight**: Over time, dopamine shifts FROM reward TO cue
- **Early Stage**: Dopamine released when reward received
- **Mid Stage**: Dopamine released at both cue and reward
- **Habit Stage**: Dopamine released at cue only; reward becomes expected baseline

**Example**:
- **First Ice Cream**: Dopamine surge when tasting
- **After 10 Ice Creams**: Dopamine surge when you see the ice cream shop
- **Habit Formed**: Walking past the shop triggers craving automatically

---

### 2. The Anticipation Principle

**Central Discovery**: Dopamine rises during anticipation, not consumption

**Scientific Foundation**:
- Wolfram Schultz's monkey experiments (1990s)
- Monkeys showed dopamine spike BEFORE reward, not during
- Once reward became predictable, dopamine shifted entirely to the cue

**Human Application**:

**Phase 1 - Novel Reward**:
```
See Cake (minimal dopamine) → Eat Cake (HIGH dopamine) → Pleasure
```

**Phase 2 - Learning**:
```
See Cake (rising dopamine) → Eat Cake (moderate dopamine) → Expected pleasure
```

**Phase 3 - Habit**:
```
See Cake (HIGH dopamine spike) → Eat Cake (baseline/slight drop) → Expectation met
```

**Why This Matters**:
- You cannot enjoy the reward more than you anticipate it
- Habits form around the craving, not the reward
- Disappointment occurs when reward < expectation
- Joy occurs when reward > expectation (surprise)

---

### 3. Wanting vs. Liking

**The Berridge Model**: Kent Berridge's research distinguishes two systems

**Wanting (Incentive Salience)**:
- Mediated by dopamine
- Drives motivation and pursuit
- Can increase without liking increasing
- Powers cravings and addiction

**Liking (Hedonic Impact)**:
- Mediated by opioid system
- Actual pleasure from consumption
- Often less intense than wanting
- Separate from motivation

**Real-World Examples**:

**Checking Phone**:
- **Wanting**: 8/10 (strong urge to check notifications)
- **Liking**: 4/10 (often disappointing when you check)
- **Result**: You check anyway, compulsively

**Scrolling Social Media**:
- **Wanting**: 9/10 (hard to resist picking up phone)
- **Liking**: 5/10 (rarely satisfying afterward)
- **Result**: Hours wasted despite no real enjoyment

**Gambling**:
- **Wanting**: 10/10 (intense craving to play)
- **Liking**: 3/10 (most pulls result in loss)
- **Result**: Addiction despite negative outcomes

**The Danger**: You can become addicted to things you don't even enjoy because wanting ≠ liking

**The Opportunity**: You can increase wanting for good habits without increasing effort

### 4. The Dopamine Spike: Craving vs. Receiving

**The Pattern**:

**Craving Phase** (High Dopamine):
- Anticipation builds
- Energy mobilizes
- Motivation peaks
- "I really want this"
- Brain imaging shows high dopamine activity

**Receiving Phase** (Dopamine Drop):
- Anticipation resolves
- Energy disperses
- Motivation fades
- "That's it?"
- Dopamine returns to baseline or below

**Example Timeline - Opening Instagram**:

```
T-10s: See phone (small dopamine rise)
T-5s: Reach for phone (dopamine climbing)
T-2s: About to open app (dopamine peak)
T-0s: App opens (dopamine starts dropping)
T+30s: Scrolling (dopamine at baseline)
T+2m: Still scrolling (dopamine below baseline, searching for next hit)
```

**Why This Creates Loops**:
1. Initial spike feels good
2. Receipt disappoints relative to anticipation
3. Brain seeks next spike to escape disappointment
4. Cycle repeats (doom scrolling, chain smoking, binge watching)

**The Treadmill Effect**: Each reward makes the next reward less satisfying, requiring stronger stimuli to achieve the same dopamine spike

---

### 5. Reward Prediction Error

**Definition**: The difference between expected and actual reward

**Formula**: RPE = Actual Reward - Expected Reward

**Outcomes**:

**Positive RPE** (Reward > Expected):
- Dopamine surges above baseline
- Strong positive reinforcement
- Behavior more likely to repeat
- Memory consolidation enhanced
- "That was better than I thought!"

**Zero RPE** (Reward = Expected):
- Dopamine remains at baseline
- Weak reinforcement
- Behavior maintained but not strengthened
- "Yeah, that's what I expected"

**Negative RPE** (Reward < Expected):
- Dopamine drops below baseline
- Negative reinforcement
- Behavior less likely to repeat
- Disappointment and potential avoidance
- "That wasn't worth it"

**Strategic Applications**:

**Building New Habits**:
- Under-promise to yourself
- Celebrate small wins bigger than expected
- Create positive prediction errors
- "I only have to do 5 pushups" → Do 10 → Feel great

**Example**:
- **Expected**: "This workout will be hard and painful"
- **Actual**: "That was challenging but I feel energized"
- **Result**: Positive RPE → Dopamine surge → Habit reinforced

**Maintaining Habits**:
- Occasional variable rewards (see next section)
- Surprise bonuses
- Unexpected progress markers
- Keep some unpredictability to prevent adaptation

---

### 6. Variable Reward Schedules (Slot Machine Effect)

**B.F. Skinner's Discovery**: Unpredictable rewards create strongest habits

**Schedule Types**:

**Fixed Ratio** (Weak):
- Reward after X repetitions
- Example: Get paid every 2 weeks
- Moderate motivation
- Predictable, less dopamine

**Variable Ratio** (Strongest):
- Reward after unpredictable number of repetitions
- Example: Slot machines, fishing, sales calls
- Highest motivation
- Unpredictable, sustained dopamine seeking

**Fixed Interval** (Weakest):
- Reward after fixed time period
- Example: Weekly meetings
- Low motivation between intervals
- Predictable, minimal dopamine

**Variable Interval** (Moderate):
- Reward after unpredictable time period
- Example: Checking email (might have message, might not)
- Moderate persistent motivation
- Some unpredictability

**Why Variable Ratio Wins**:
- Each action could be "the one"
- Dopamine sustains across multiple attempts
- Prevents adaptation/boredom
- Creates compulsive repetition

**Real-World Applications**:

**Addictive (Variable Ratio)**:
- **Social Media**: Each scroll might reveal something interesting
- **Email**: Each check might have important message
- **Dating Apps**: Each swipe might be "the match"
- **Gambling**: Each pull might be jackpot
- **Video Games**: Each action might drop rare item

**Less Addictive (Fixed Ratio)**:
- **Salary**: Same paycheck every time
- **Predictable Rewards**: Same outcome guaranteed
- **Fixed Routines**: No surprise element

**Using It For Good Habits**:
- Add occasional surprise rewards to habit routine
- Create unpredictable positive reinforcement
- Example: Every few workouts, surprise yourself with nice meal
- Keep small element of randomness in tracking
- Gamify with random bonuses

### 7. How Social Media Exploits Dopamine

**The Architecture of Addiction**:

**1. Infinite Scroll**:
- **Mechanism**: No natural stopping point
- **Dopamine Effect**: Continuous variable reward loop
- **Result**: "Just one more post" × 100

**2. Pull-to-Refresh**:
- **Mechanism**: Mimics slot machine lever
- **Dopamine Effect**: Physical action triggers anticipation spike
- **Result**: Compulsive checking behavior

**3. Notifications (Red Dots)**:
- **Mechanism**: Visual cue of potential reward
- **Dopamine Effect**: Anticipatory spike, must check to resolve
- **Result**: Cannot ignore, must open immediately

**4. Likes and Social Validation**:
- **Mechanism**: Unpredictable social feedback
- **Dopamine Effect**: Variable ratio reinforcement
- **Result**: Constant posting and checking for validation

**5. Autoplay Next Video**:
- **Mechanism**: Removes decision friction
- **Dopamine Effect**: Passive continuation of reward stream
- **Result**: Binge watching for hours

**6. Algorithmic Feeds**:
- **Mechanism**: AI optimizes for engagement
- **Dopamine Effect**: Personalized variable rewards
- **Result**: Platform learns exactly how to hook you

**The Dopamine Timeline**:

```
Phone buzzes (notification) → Dopamine SPIKE
Look at phone → Dopamine CLIMBING
Unlock phone → Dopamine PEAK
Open app → Dopamine begins dropping
View content → Dopamine at baseline
Keep scrolling → Dopamine below baseline (seeking next hit)
Find interesting post → Small dopamine bump
Keep scrolling → Dopamine below baseline
[CYCLE CONTINUES]
Close app → Dopamine crash
[Minutes later] → Brain seeks next dopamine hit → Reach for phone
```

**Why It's So Powerful**:
- Combines ALL dopamine exploits
- Variable rewards + social validation + infinite supply
- Optimized by billions in R&D
- Designed by experts to maximize engagement
- Your primitive brain has no defense

### 8. Supernormal Stimuli in the Modern World

**Definition**: Exaggerated versions of natural stimuli that trigger stronger responses than natural versions

**Concept Origin**: Nikolaas Tinbergen (1930s-40s)

**Animal Examples**:
- **Birds**: Prefer giant fake eggs over their own
- **Butterflies**: More attracted to artificial bright colors
- **Fish**: Respond more to exaggerated model fish

**Human Applications**:

**Natural Stimulus → Supernormal Version**:

1. **Sweet Taste** (signals ripe fruit, energy)
   - Natural: Apple (10g sugar)
   - Supernormal: Soda (39g sugar)
   - Supernormal+: Candy (90% sugar)

2. **Fat/Protein** (signals calorie-dense food)
   - Natural: Nuts, fish
   - Supernormal: Bacon cheeseburger
   - Supernormal+: Processed fast food engineered for "bliss point"

3. **Sexual Attraction** (signals reproductive opportunity)
   - Natural: Potential partners in social circle
   - Supernormal: Airbrushed magazine models
   - Supernormal+: Pornography with unlimited variety

4. **Social Connection** (signals tribal belonging)
   - Natural: Face-to-face conversation
   - Supernormal: Text messages with instant responses
   - Supernormal+: Social media with likes/followers

5. **Novelty** (signals learning opportunity)
   - Natural: New person or place occasionally
   - Supernormal: TV channel surfing
   - Supernormal+: Infinite scroll social feeds

6. **Achievement** (signals progress toward goals)
   - Natural: Hunt successful, shelter built
   - Supernormal: Video game level-ups
   - Supernormal+: Mobile games with constant rewards

**The Mismatch Problem**:

**Evolution**: Brain designed for scarcity
- Sugar rare → Binge when available
- Novelty rare → Pay attention to new things
- Social approval limited → Seek tribal acceptance

**Modern World**: Abundance of supernormal stimuli
- Sugar everywhere → Obesity epidemic
- Novelty unlimited → Attention fragmentation
- Social approval scalable → Validation addiction

**The Dopamine Hijacking**:
- Natural stimuli: Modest dopamine response
- Supernormal stimuli: Massive dopamine response
- Brain learns: "This is 10x better than natural version"
- Result: Natural rewards feel boring, unsatisfying

**Consequences**:
- Books feel slow after TikTok
- Real conversations feel boring after texting
- Healthy food tasteless after junk food
- Real relationships unsatisfying after social media validation
- Actual achievement underwhelming after video game rewards

**Example Cascade**:
```
Watch TV (supernormal entertainment)
  ↓
Real conversations seem boring
  ↓
Seek more TV
  ↓
Baseline dopamine sensitivity decreases
  ↓
Need stronger stimuli to feel good
  ↓
Upgrade to social media/gaming
  ↓
Real life even more boring
  ↓
[DOWNWARD SPIRAL]
```

### 9. Dopamine Detox Concepts

**Purpose**: Reset dopamine sensitivity to restore natural reward responsiveness

**The Problem Being Solved**:
- Chronic overstimulation desensitizes dopamine receptors
- Higher baseline dopamine needed to feel normal
- Natural pleasures feel inadequate
- Constant need for stimulation

**The Solution Framework**:

**Level 1 - Soft Detox** (24 Hours):
- Remove highly stimulating activities for one day
- Allow: Walking, cooking, reading, conversation
- Avoid: Phone, internet, TV, sugar, caffeine
- **Goal**: Notice how much you reach for stimulation

**Level 2 - Medium Detox** (Weekend):
- 2-3 days of minimal dopamine hits
- Allow: Nature, exercise, meditation, journaling
- Avoid: All screens, processed food, music
- **Goal**: Boredom tolerance, creativity return

**Level 3 - Deep Detox** (Week):
- 7 days of low-dopamine lifestyle
- Allow: Basic activities, nature, sleep, simple food
- Avoid: All unnecessary stimulation
- **Goal**: Dopamine receptor upregulation

**What to Expect**:

**Hours 0-4**:
- Frequent urges to check phone/eat sugar
- Restlessness, boredom
- "What am I supposed to do?"

**Hours 4-12**:
- Irritability peak
- Strong cravings
- Awareness of habitual reaching

**Hours 12-24**:
- Cravings reduce
- Mind starts wandering creatively
- Moments of calm

**Days 2-3**:
- Boredom becomes tolerable
- Appreciation for simple pleasures returns
- Ideas and insights emerge

**Days 4-7**:
- Natural activities feel rewarding again
- Baseline mood stabilizes higher
- Less need for constant stimulation
- Creative energy returns

**Post-Detox Integration**:
- Reintroduce stimuli gradually
- Notice which ones truly add value
- Many former "necessities" lose appeal
- Conscious relationship with dopamine sources

**Common Mistakes**:
- Going too extreme (creates unsustainable deprivation)
- Not planning replacement activities
- Giving up at first discomfort
- Not addressing underlying issues (stress, meaning, connection)

### 10. Using Dopamine Strategically for Good Habits

**Principle**: Engineer dopamine responses to favor desired behaviors

**Strategy 1: Temptation Bundling**
- Pair "want" activity with "should" activity
- Example: Only watch Netflix while on treadmill
- Result: Treadmill becomes cue for dopamine-releasing activity

**Implementation**:
```
BEFORE: Treadmill (low dopamine) vs Netflix (high dopamine) → Choose Netflix
AFTER: Treadmill = Netflix access (high dopamine from anticipation) → Choose treadmill
```

**Examples**:
- Listen to audiobooks only while walking
- Watch favorite show only while meal prepping
- Check social media only after writing 500 words
- Enjoy coffee only after morning workout

**Strategy 2: Anticipation Amplification**
- Build up anticipation before good habits
- Create pre-habit rituals that spike dopamine
- Make the cue more attractive

**Examples**:
- **Morning Workout**: Lay out clothes night before, set motivating alarm, pre-workout drink ritual
- **Writing**: Favorite coffee, specific playlist, clean desk setup
- **Meditation**: Light candle, incense, comfortable cushion
- Result: Dopamine begins rising before the habit starts

**Strategy 3: Immediate Sensory Rewards**
- Add immediate pleasurable element to good habits
- Don't wait for long-term benefits
- Create positive reinforcement in the moment

**Examples**:
- **Healthy Eating**: Make it delicious, beautiful presentation
- **Exercise**: Enjoyable music, scenic route, satisfying movement
- **Reading**: Comfortable chair, good lighting, favorite tea
- **Productivity**: Satisfying checkboxes, progress bars, visual wins

**Strategy 4: Variable Reward Integration**
- Add unpredictability to maintain interest
- Occasional surprise bonuses
- Gamification elements

**Examples**:
- Every 10 workouts, surprise reward (massage, new gear, nice meal)
- Random bonus challenges with prizes
- Unexpected progress milestones celebration
- Mystery reward envelope system

**Strategy 5: Social Dopamine Leveraging**
- Use social validation as dopamine source
- Share progress publicly
- Join communities with encouragement

**Examples**:
- Post workout photos to accountability group
- Weekly check-ins with habit partner
- Public commitment declarations
- Progress sharing on social media (strategic use)

**Strategy 6: Progress Visualization**
- Make progress visible and satisfying
- Physical/visual representations of growth
- Tap into achievement dopamine

**Examples**:
- Habit tracker with satisfying checkmarks
- Visual progress charts
- Photo timeline of transformation
- Physical tokens (marbles in jar, chain links)

**Strategy 7: The 2-Minute Rule + Dopamine**
- Start so small that dopamine isn't depleted
- Early wins create positive association
- Build momentum before resistance kicks in

**Examples**:
- "Just put on running shoes" (easy dopamine win)
- "Just write one sentence" (no intimidation)
- "Just do one push-up" (guaranteed success)
- Small win → Dopamine → Often continue → Habit builds

**Strategy 8: Reframe to Increase Wanting**
- Change mental association with habit
- Shift from "have to" to "get to"
- Connect to deeper identity/values

**Examples**:
- **Exercise**: Not "have to exercise" but "training session" (identity: athlete)
- **Vegetables**: Not "should eat healthy" but "fueling my body" (identity: high-performer)
- **Meditation**: Not "sitting still" but "training my mind" (identity: disciplined person)

**The Complete System**:

```
1. Choose habit that aligns with identity
2. Make cue obvious and attractive (anticipation spike)
3. Add immediate sensory reward (dopamine during activity)
4. Bundle with existing high-dopamine activity if needed
5. Track progress visibly (achievement dopamine)
6. Occasional variable rewards (sustain interest)
7. Social reinforcement (validation dopamine)
8. Celebrate wins more than expected (positive prediction error)
```

### 11. How Habits Shift Dopamine from Reward to Cue

**The Transformation Arc**:

**Stage 1 - Novelty** (Learning Phase):
```
See Gym → No particular feeling
Enter Gym → Mild anticipation
Start Workout → Effort/discomfort
Finish Workout → Dopamine release + endorphins
Post-Workout → "That felt good, I should do that again"
```

**Stage 2 - Association** (Habit Formation):
```
See Gym → Small dopamine bump (anticipation building)
Enter Gym → Moderate dopamine (craving forming)
Start Workout → Dopamine peak then gradual decline
Finish Workout → Moderate dopamine (becoming expected)
Post-Workout → "Yeah, that's what usually happens"
```

**Stage 3 - Automaticity** (Habit Established):
```
See Gym → Major dopamine spike (automatic craving)
Enter Gym → High dopamine (strong anticipatory pleasure)
Start Workout → Dopamine at baseline (effort feels normal)
Finish Workout → Slight dopamine drop or baseline (expectation met)
Post-Workout → "Time to do something else"
```

**The Critical Insight**: The dopamine reward moves from the END to the BEGINNING

**Why This Matters for Building Habits**:

**Early Days** (Difficult):
- Dopamine only comes after completion
- Requires willpower to start
- Motivation needed to push through
- Reward delayed

**After Habit Forms** (Automatic):
- Dopamine comes from the cue itself
- Automatic impulse to start
- Less willpower needed
- The habit IS the reward

**Example: Morning Coffee**:

**First Week**:
- Alarm rings → Grogginess
- Make coffee → Effort
- Drink coffee → "Ahh, this is nice" (dopamine)

**After 3 Months**:
- Alarm rings → Immediate thought of coffee (small dopamine)
- Smell coffee brewing → Major dopamine spike (anticipation)
- Drink coffee → Baseline feeling (expected)

**The person craves making coffee, not drinking it**

**Practical Application**:

**For Building Habits**:
- Push through early phase when dopamine is only at the end
- Use external rewards during formation
- Trust that cue will eventually become rewarding
- Don't quit before the shift happens

**For Breaking Habits**:
- Understand the cue triggers dopamine, not just the behavior
- Removing the behavior won't remove the craving
- Must break the cue-dopamine association
- Replace with different response to same cue

**Timeline for Dopamine Shift**:
- Begins: ~10-20 repetitions
- Noticeable: ~30-50 repetitions
- Solidified: ~100+ repetitions
- Varies by complexity and reward magnitude

**Evidence You're In Stage 3**:
- You WANT to do the habit
- Not doing it feels uncomfortable
- The cue automatically triggers urge
- The behavior feels effortless to start
- Missing a day feels "off"

## LLM-ACTIONABLE-INSIGHTS

### For Coaching and Guidance

**When user wants to start good habit**:
1. Explain dopamine will only come at END initially
2. This is temporary - cue will become rewarding
3. Use external rewards/temptation bundling to bridge gap
4. Expect 30-50 reps before it feels automatic
5. Focus on making the cue attractive and obvious

**When user struggles with bad habit**:
1. Identify what CUE triggers dopamine spike
2. Explain wanting vs. liking gap
3. Note they're craving anticipation, not result
4. Strategy: Remove/modify cue, not just resist behavior
5. Replace response to cue with alternative

**When user feels unmotivated**:
1. Remind: Motivation is downstream of dopamine system
2. Design environment to trigger anticipation
3. Add immediate sensory rewards
4. Use variable reward schedule
5. Consider if overstimulation has dulled natural rewards

**When user plateaus**:
1. Check if rewards have become too predictable
2. Add variable element to sustain dopamine
3. Create unexpected positive prediction errors
4. Reframe to reconnect with identity-based motivation

### Diagnostic Questions

**To understand dopamine relationship**:
- "What do you crave more - starting or finishing?"
- "When do you feel the urge most strongly?"
- "What makes you WANT to do it vs LIKE doing it?"
- "How does the anticipation compare to the actual experience?"
- "What triggers the thought/urge to do this?"

**To identify exploitation**:
- "How do you feel during vs. after?"
- "Would you still do this if the result was guaranteed but delayed?"
- "Does this use variable rewards (unpredictability)?"
- "Is this more stimulating than natural version?"

### Implementation Formulas

**Habit Formation Formula**:
```
Attractive Cue + High Anticipation + Immediate Small Reward + Identity Connection = Strong Dopamine Association
```

**Habit Breaking Formula**:
```
Remove Cue + Reduce Anticipation + Delay Gratification + Alternative Response = Weakened Dopamine Association
```

**Dopamine Reset Formula**:
```
Eliminate Supernormal Stimuli + Wait for Discomfort to Pass + Reintroduce Natural Rewards = Restored Sensitivity
```

### Pattern Recognition

**Signs of dopamine exploitation**:
- High wanting, low liking
- Compulsive repetition despite no enjoyment
- Can't stop even when wanting to
- Feels worse after than before
- Increasing stimulation needed for same effect
- Natural pleasures feel boring
- Constant seeking, never satisfied

**Signs of healthy dopamine function**:
- Anticipation matches satisfaction
- Feeling good during and after
- Natural stopping point
- Sustainable without escalation
- Natural rewards feel rewarding
- Clear before/after improvement
- Satisfaction leads to contentment, not seeking

### Customization Parameters

**High dopamine sensitivity** (easily motivated):
- Can use smaller rewards
- May need dopamine detox less often
- Risk of overstimulation
- Natural rewards sufficient

**Low dopamine sensitivity** (struggle with motivation):
- Need stronger initial rewards
- May benefit from dopamine detox
- Require more obvious cues
- Stack multiple dopamine strategies

**Optimization over time**:
- Start: Strong external rewards
- Middle: Reduce external, increase internal
- Established: Identity and cue-based dopamine sufficient
- Maintenance: Occasional variable rewards to prevent boredom

---

## Summary

Dopamine is the driver of habit formation, released primarily during ANTICIPATION rather than reward. This creates powerful cravings that can be stronger than the actual pleasure of completion (wanting > liking). Modern supernormal stimuli exploit this system, creating addictive behaviors that feel compulsive despite providing little real satisfaction.

The key to habit formation is understanding that dopamine shifts from the reward to the cue over time. Initially, you need willpower to complete a behavior and receive the dopamine reward. Eventually, the cue itself triggers dopamine, creating automatic craving and effortless execution.

Strategic use of dopamine mechanisms - temptation bundling, immediate rewards, variable schedules, anticipation building, and progress celebration - can engineer powerful positive habits. Conversely, removing cues and avoiding supernormal stimuli can help break negative patterns.

The modern challenge is dopamine overstimulation from engineered products (social media, junk food, pornography, video games) that hijack primitive reward systems with supernormal intensity. Periodic dopamine detoxes can reset sensitivity and restore the ability to find pleasure in natural rewards.

Understanding your relationship with dopamine - what triggers it, when you feel it, and whether wanting matches liking - is fundamental to conscious habit design and behavioral change.
