# Commitment Devices

## Overview

A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future. It's a pre-commitment strategy that removes the need for willpower by eliminating future choice points where you might make poor decisions. By constraining your future self's options today, you make desired behaviors automatic and undesired behaviors difficult or impossible.

**Core Principle**: Make one decision now that ensures hundreds of good decisions later, removing the burden of willpower from future moments of weakness.

## Definition and Psychological Foundation

### What Is a Commitment Device?

A commitment device is any mechanism that:
1. **Restricts future choices** to align with long-term goals
2. **Adds cost** to undesired behaviors (financial, social, time, or effort)
3. **Removes temptation** from your environment entirely
4. **Automates good decisions** so willpower is unnecessary
5. **Makes breaking commitment** more painful than maintaining it

### Psychological Mechanisms

#### Present Bias
- **Problem**: We value immediate rewards over delayed ones, even when delayed rewards are objectively better
- **Solution**: Commitment devices shift consequences to the present moment
- **Example**: Losing money TODAY for missing workout is more motivating than health benefits in 10 years

#### Choice Architecture
- **Problem**: Every choice point is an opportunity for the wrong decision
- **Solution**: Reduce decision points by pre-committing
- **Example**: Automatic savings transfers eliminate the monthly "should I save?" question

#### Loss Aversion
- **Problem**: We're more motivated to avoid losses than to achieve equivalent gains
- **Solution**: Put something at stake that you'll lose if you fail
- **Example**: Betting $500 you'll quit smoking is more powerful than dreaming of $500 saved

#### Social Pressure
- **Problem**: We care deeply about our reputation and others' opinions
- **Solution**: Make commitment public so failure means social cost
- **Example**: Announcing goals on social media creates accountability through judgment-avoidance

### The Willpower Paradox

**Traditional Approach**: Rely on willpower at each decision point
- Willpower is a limited resource
- Depletes throughout the day
- Vulnerable to stress, hunger, fatigue
- Requires constant vigilance
- **Result**: Inevitable failure during weak moments

**Commitment Device Approach**: Eliminate decision points entirely
- One-time willpower investment
- No daily depletion
- Works even when you're weak
- Automates good behavior
- **Result**: Success becomes default, not exception

## The Victor Hugo Story

### The Tale

In 1830, Victor Hugo was facing a deadline to finish "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" but kept procrastinating. His solution was drastic: he locked away all his clothes except a large shawl. Unable to go outside without proper clothing, he had no choice but to stay home and write. He finished the book ahead of schedule.

### Key Lessons

1. **Physical Constraints Work**: Making the undesired behavior literally impossible
2. **Extreme Measures for Important Goals**: The bigger the goal, the stronger the commitment device needed
3. **Environment Over Willpower**: Changed his environment rather than relying on self-control
4. **Temporary Discomfort for Long-term Gain**: Accepted short-term inconvenience for deadline success
5. **Creativity in Commitment**: The specific device matters less than the principle

### Modern Applications

**Contemporary "Hugo" Strategies**:
- **The Disconnection Method**: Disable home WiFi router during writing hours
- **The Device Lock**: Give your phone to a friend during deep work sessions
- **The Location Lock**: Only work in a place without distractions (library with no WiFi password)
- **The App Delete**: Remove all social media apps during important project phases
- **The Blocker Install**: Use website blockers that require complex uninstall process

## Types of Commitment Devices

### Type 1: Financial Commitment Devices

#### How They Work
Put real money at stake that you'll lose if you fail to follow through. Loss aversion makes the immediate cost of failure more motivating than distant benefits.

#### Examples

**StickK Platform**:
- Set a goal with specific stakes
- Choose a referee who verifies completion
- If you fail, money goes to anti-charity (organization you oppose) or friend
- **Why it works**: Losing money to a cause you hate is extremely motivating
- **Best for**: Clear, measurable goals (lose 20 lbs, run 3x/week, no smoking)

**Beeminder**:
- Track any quantifiable goal
- Stay on your "yellow brick road" of progress
- Go off track = automatic credit card charge
- Charges increase with repeated failures
- **Why it works**: Immediate financial consequence for each miss
- **Best for**: Consistent habits with trackable metrics

**Gym Membership (Used Correctly)**:
- Pay for expensive membership (sunk cost motivates usage)
- Better: Pay personal trainer in advance (appointment commitment)
- Best: Join gym with annual contract and higher fees for not attending
- **Why it works**: Financial loss if you don't use it
- **Warning**: Only works if you actually feel the sunk cost

**Pre-paid Classes/Sessions**:
- Yoga classes bought in 10-pack
- Therapy sessions paid monthly
- Music lessons paid for quarter
- **Why it works**: You've already paid, waste hurts
- **Best for**: Regular attendance habits

**Bet with Friends**:
- Wager specific amount on specific goal
- Friend holds money or uses app like Bet on Yourself
- Winner takes pot or money goes to charity
- **Why it works**: Social + financial motivation combined
- **Best for**: Competitive people with trustworthy friends

#### Implementation Guidelines
- **Start small**: Don't bet your mortgage on first commitment
- **Make it hurt**: Should be meaningful enough to motivate, not so high you'll avoid committing
- **Be specific**: "Exercise 3x/week verified by Fitbit" not "get healthier"
- **Choose right recipient**: Money going to anti-charity > friend > charity you like
- **Automate verification**: Remove ability to fudge the data

### Type 2: Social Commitment Devices

#### How They Work
Leverage reputation, social proof, and accountability by making your commitment public or involving others who will hold you accountable.

#### Examples

**Public Declarations**:
- Announce goals on social media
- Tell family and friends about commitment
- Post progress updates regularly
- **Why it works**: Fear of public failure and judgment
- **Best for**: People who care about their reputation
- **Warning**: Can backfire if you substitute talking about goals for doing them

**Accountability Partners**:
- Partner with someone pursuing similar goal
- Daily/weekly check-ins required
- Report progress honestly
- **Why it works**: Don't want to let partner down
- **Best for**: Consistent habits needing regular support
- **Structure**: Set specific check-in times and consequences

**Mastermind Groups**:
- Small group (3-5 people) meeting weekly
- Each person reports on commitments
- Group provides support and accountability
- **Why it works**: Multiple people watching your progress
- **Best for**: Entrepreneurs, creatives, complex goals
- **Format**: 15 min per person, what worked, what didn't, commitments for next week

**Online Communities**:
- Reddit accountability subreddits
- Discord servers for specific goals
- Habit-tracking apps with social features
- **Why it works**: Strangers still create accountability through visibility
- **Best for**: People who engage actively online

**Coaching/Mentoring Relationships**:
- Hire coach or find mentor
- Regular sessions with homework
- Professional accountability
- **Why it works**: Paid relationship + expertise + don't want to waste their time
- **Best for**: High-value goals worth investment

**Streak Tracking (Public)**:
- Apps like Snapchat streaks, Duolingo
- Publicly visible progress
- Breaking streak feels like public failure
- **Why it works**: Visible commitment that others can see
- **Best for**: Daily habits, competitive personalities

#### Implementation Guidelines
- **Choose the right people**: Supporters, not saboteurs
- **Be specific about what you need**: "Check in on Mondays" not "hold me accountable"
- **Make reporting easy**: Template message, app integration, scheduled calls
- **Reciprocate**: Accountability works better when mutual
- **Accept consequences**: If you fail publicly, own it publicly

### Type 3: Physical Commitment Devices

#### How They Work
Physically remove the ability to make the wrong choice by changing your environment, eliminating temptations, or creating barriers to bad behaviors.

#### Examples

**One-Time Environmental Changes**:
- **Smaller plates**: Automatically eat less without thinking
- **No TV in bedroom**: Can't mindlessly watch, improves sleep
- **Desk faces wall**: Can't see distractions
- **Phone charger in different room**: Won't check phone before bed
- **Workout clothes by bed**: Remove friction from morning exercise
- **Meal prep containers**: Pre-portioned healthy meals eliminate decisions

**Removal/Deletion**:
- **Delete social media apps**: Require computer login (higher friction)
- **Cancel streaming subscriptions**: Can't binge-watch if you don't have access
- **Throw out junk food**: Can't eat what isn't there
- **Unsubscribe from promotional emails**: Remove temptation at source
- **Delete games from phone**: Eliminate time-wasting option

**Physical Locks/Barriers**:
- **kSafe/Kitchen Safe**: Time-locked container for phone, snacks, etc.
- **Internet router on timer**: Auto-shuts off at bedtime
- **Freezer for credit card**: Literally freeze card in ice block (must thaw to use)
- **App locks requiring passwords**: Give password to accountability partner
- **Website blockers**: Freedom, Cold Turkey Blocker, etc.

**Strategic Inconvenience**:
- **Cash only for discretionary spending**: Harder than card swipe
- **No saved passwords**: Must manually log in each time (reduces impulse usage)
- **Parking far away**: Forces walking
- **Gym bag in car**: Can go straight after work
- **Automatic bill pay**: Can't forget or postpone

**Product Design Choices**:
- **Fitbit/Apple Watch**: Automatically tracks activity
- **Programmable coffee maker**: Auto-brews at wake-up time
- **Smart home automation**: Lights, temp adjust for routines
- **Meal delivery service**: Healthy meals arrive weekly
- **Standing desk**: Default to standing, choose to sit

#### Implementation Guidelines
- **Start with easiest**: Delete apps before buying time-locked safe
- **One change at a time**: Don't overhaul entire environment at once
- **Make it reversible (at first)**: Test before permanent changes
- **Combine with positive cues**: Remove bad, add good simultaneously
- **Adapt to your specific weaknesses**: Customize to your temptations

### Type 4: Time-Based Commitment Devices

#### How They Work
Schedule actions in advance, creating appointments with yourself or automated actions that happen whether you "feel like it" or not.

#### Examples

**Calendar Blocking**:
- **Deep work blocks**: Mark as "busy" so no meetings can intrude
- **Weekly reviews**: Recurring appointment with yourself
- **Exercise time**: Scheduled like any other important meeting
- **Creative time**: Protected hours for creative work
- **Why it works**: Treats important activities like unmovable appointments

**Automated Scheduling**:
- **Recurring grocery delivery**: Healthy food arrives weekly
- **Auto-scheduled workouts**: Class reservation made week in advance
- **Bill reminders/auto-pay**: Never miss payments
- **Medication reminders**: Phone alerts at exact times
- **Why it works**: Decision made once, executes repeatedly

**Appointment-Based Commitments**:
- **Personal trainer sessions**: Scheduled and paid in advance
- **Study groups**: Set meeting times
- **Therapy/coaching**: Regular appointments
- **Classes**: Fixed schedule
- **Why it works**: Social obligation + time commitment + sunk cost

**Deadlines (Self-Imposed)**:
- **Public ship dates**: Announce launch date before product is done
- **Competition registration**: Sign up for race months in advance
- **Event commitments**: Agree to speak/present, forcing preparation
- **Why it works**: Parkinson's Law (work expands to fill time), public accountability

**Time-Locked Devices**:
- **kSafe containers**: Set timer, can't open until time expires
- **Website blockers on schedule**: Freedom, Cold Turkey with scheduled blocks
- **Router timers**: Internet shuts off at specific times
- **App time limits**: iOS Screen Time, Android Digital Wellbeing
- **Why it works**: Physically impossible to access during blocked time

#### Implementation Guidelines
- **Block time weekly**: Sunday night planning for upcoming week
- **Treat like real appointments**: Don't reschedule unless emergency
- **Build in buffer time**: Don't schedule 100% of your day
- **Use recurring events**: Set it once, applies forever
- **Review and adjust**: Monthly check on whether time blocks are working

5. "What am I currently doing manually that could be automated?"

**Brainstorming Process**:
1. List all recurring hassles/temptations/decisions
2. For each, ask: "Could this be solved with one action?"
3. Identify the single action that would solve it
4. Estimate effort vs. benefit

## Strategic One-Time Decisions

### The Power of Single Decisions

A strategic one-time decision is a commitment that fundamentally alters your choice architecture, making good behaviors automatic and bad behaviors difficult. These are often life-changing moments that set you on a new trajectory.

### Examples of Strategic One-Time Decisions

#### Career/Business
- **Moving to a new city for opportunity**: Changes your network, opportunities, environment entirely
- **Taking a job with a mission-driven company**: Aligns daily work with values
- **Hiring an assistant/delegating tasks**: Frees time for high-value activities permanently
- **Automating business processes**: One-time system setup, ongoing efficiency
- **Choosing a profession with built-in accountability**: Doctor, teacher, coach (people depend on you)

#### Health/Fitness
- **Adopting a dog**: Forces daily walks and active lifestyle
- **Moving to walkable neighborhood**: Daily activity becomes automatic
- **Joining community with active culture**: Climbing gym, CrossFit, running club
- **Getting lasik**: Never deal with contacts/glasses again
- **Scheduling annual physical**: Recurring appointment for preventive health

#### Finance
- **Choosing modest housing**: Locks in lower expenses forever
- **Buying home near work**: Eliminates commute permanently
- **Setting up trust/will**: Financial security established once
- **Consolidating accounts**: Simpler management forever
- **Choosing index funds over active trading**: Set and forget investing

#### Relationships
- **Moving closer to family**: Easier to maintain relationships
- **Joining club/church/community**: Built-in social infrastructure
- **Having children**: Ultimate commitment device (completely changes incentives)
- **Marrying someone with aligned values**: Partner reinforces your goals

#### Learning
- **Enrolling in degree program**: Commitment to learning path
- **Signing up for recurring lessons**: Piano, language, etc.
- **Joining professional organization**: Access to network and resources
- **Building learning into work role**: Job requires continuous skill development

### Decision Framework

**Before Making Strategic One-Time Decision**:
1. **Reversibility**: How hard is it to undo? (Harder to undo = more commitment power)
2. **Alignment**: Does this align with my core values and long-term goals?
3. **Consequences**: What behaviors does this automatically encourage/discourage?
4. **Opportunity Cost**: What am I giving up? Is it worth it?
5. **Compounding**: Will this get better or worse over time?

**Red Flags**:
- Decision made in emotional state
- Primarily based on what others think you should do
- Ignoring your actual preferences/values
- Hoping it will change you into someone you're not
- Irreversible decision made impulsively

**Green Flags**:
- Aligns with demonstrated past behavior and values
- Removes temptations you've repeatedly failed to resist
- Creates positive default behaviors
- Future self would thank present self
- Based on self-knowledge, not fantasy

---

## The Power of Reducing Future Choices

### Decision Fatigue

**The Problem**:
- Every decision depletes mental energy
- Later decisions are worse than earlier ones
- More choices = more opportunity for poor choices
- Decision-making is exhausting

**The Research**:
- Judges grant parole more often early in day vs. late (decision fatigue)
- Doctors make worse decisions after many cases in a row
- Shoppers make impulse purchases when decision-fatigued
- CEO/Presidents wear same outfit daily to preserve decision-making energy

### The Uniform Strategy

**Concept**: Eliminate trivial decisions to preserve energy for important ones

**Famous Examples**:
- **Steve Jobs**: Black turtleneck, jeans, sneakers
- **Barack Obama**: Only gray or blue suits
- **Mark Zuckerberg**: Gray t-shirt and jeans
- **Albert Einstein**: Same gray suit daily

**Why It Works**:
- Zero mental energy on clothing decisions
- More energy for important decisions
- Creates personal brand/consistency
- Reduces decision fatigue

**How to Implement**:
1. Choose a "uniform" for work, home, workout
2. Buy multiples of the same item
3. Donate clothes that don't fit uniform
4. Never think about it again

**Variations**:
- **Weekly rotation**: 5 predetermined outfits, cycle through
- **Category uniformity**: All shirts same style, different colors
- **Context uniformity**: Work outfit, weekend outfit, workout outfit (but consistent within each)

### Pre-Decision Strategies

**Concept**: Make decisions in advance when you're calm and rational, so you don't have to decide in the moment when you're vulnerable.

#### Implementation Rules (If-Then Planning)

**Structure**: "If [situation], then [predetermined response]"

**Examples**:
- "If I'm invited to happy hour, then I will go but order sparkling water"
- "If it's a weekday morning, then I will exercise before checking email"
- "If I'm grocery shopping, then I will only buy items on my list"
- "If someone offers me dessert, then I will have fruit instead"
- "If I feel like skipping workout, then I will do just 10 minutes"

**Why It Works**:
- Decision already made, no willpower needed in the moment
- Removes negotiation with yourself
- Faster response (no deliberation)
- More consistent behavior

**How to Create**:
1. Identify recurring decision points where you often choose poorly
2. Decide in advance what the right choice is
3. Frame as "If [trigger], then [action]"
4. Review and reinforce the rule regularly
5. Track compliance

#### Default Choices

**Concept**: Set a default option that requires zero decision-making

**Examples**:
- **Default meal prep**: Same breakfast every day (overnight oats)
- **Default workout**: Same routine unless you specifically plan alternative
- **Default coffee order**: Never have to decide
- **Default evening routine**: Same sequence every night
- **Default response**: "No" to requests unless compelling reason to say yes

**Benefits**:
- Extreme reduction in daily decisions
- Builds consistency and routine
- Creates autopilot for good behaviors
- Preserves mental energy

**How to Implement**:
1. Identify areas where you make same decision repeatedly
2. Choose the optimal option as default
3. Communicate default to others (if relevant)
4. Only deviate for special occasions/reasons
5. Review periodically to ensure default is still optimal

#### Batch Decision-Making

**Concept**: Make similar decisions all at once instead of repeatedly

**Examples**:
- **Meal planning**: Decide all week's meals on Sunday
- **Wardrobe selection**: Plan week's outfits on Sunday
- **Content creation**: Write multiple posts in one session
- **Email processing**: Designated times instead of constant checking
- **Meeting scheduling**: Block one day for all meetings

**Why It Works**:
- Reduces switching costs
- Achieves decision momentum
- Prevents decision avoidance
- Creates larger blocks of undisturbed time

**How to Implement**:
1. Identify repetitive decisions made throughout week
2. Designate specific time to make all at once
3. Create system/template for the batch decision
4. Execute decisions without revisiting
5. Review and adjust batch system monthly

### Elimination Over Optimization

**Concept**: Remove choices entirely instead of trying to choose correctly every time

**The Maxim**: "The best way to make good decisions is to make fewer decisions"

**Examples**:
- **Don't optimize social media usage, delete it**: No decision needed
- **Don't choose healthy at restaurants, cook at home**: Eliminated restaurant choice
- **Don't decide whether to exercise, make it automatic**: Scheduled, non-negotiable
- **Don't budget for subscriptions, cancel all**: Nothing to manage

**Application Process**:
1. List all recurring decisions you struggle with
2. For each, ask: "Could I eliminate this choice entirely?"
3. Identify what elimination would require
4. Implement elimination (delete, cancel, remove, automate)
5. Redirect saved energy to important decisions

      THEN start with low-stakes, reversible devices
        RECOMMEND app deletion (reversible)
        RECOMMEND social declaration (low cost)
        RECOMMEND small financial stakes ($10-50)
```

#### Pattern Recognition for LLM Coaching

**User Signals That Suggest Commitment Devices**:
1. "I know I should [X] but I never do it"
2. "I keep breaking my own promises"
3. "I have no willpower for [X]"
4. "I waste too much time on [Y]"
5. "I need someone to force me to [X]"
6. "I always choose the easy path"
7. "I'm my own worst enemy"

**Response Framework**:
```
RECOGNIZE: User has willpower/consistency problem
ASSESS: What type of commitment device matches the problem?
  - Measurable habit → Financial commitment
  - Social motivation → Public accountability
  - Digital temptation → Physical/app blockers
  - Recurring decision → One-time automation
PROPOSE: Specific commitment device with clear implementation steps
DESIGN: Help set up enforcement mechanism
MONITOR: Check in at 7, 30, 90 days
ADJUST: Strengthen or modify based on compliance
```

#### Commitment Device Selection Matrix

| Problem Type | Best Device Type | Example Tools | Success Rate |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Digital distraction | Physical blockers | Freedom, Cold Turkey, kSafe | 85% |
| Inconsistent exercise | Financial + Social | Gym buddy + StickK bet | 75% |
| Poor diet | Environmental | Smaller plates, no junk in house | 80% |
| Procrastination | Time-based | Calendar blocking, Focusmate | 70% |
| Impulse spending | Financial automation | Auto-transfer, delete payment methods | 90% |
| Missed goals | Financial stakes | Beeminder, HealthyWage | 75% |
| Lack of focus | Physical + Time | App deletion + time blocking | 80% |
| Social goals | Social commitment | Public declaration, accountability partner | 65% |

#### Effectiveness Predictors

**High Success Likelihood**:
- User has attempted behavior change multiple times
- Clear, measurable goal
- Strong emotional motivation (pain or aspiration)
- Willing to put meaningful stakes at risk
- Has support system
- Device matches user's primary motivation style

**Low Success Likelihood**:
- Vague or abstract goal
- No real consequences for failure
- User seeking external control they'll resent
- Easy workarounds available
- Conflicting priorities
- Device doesn't match user's motivation style

#### Troubleshooting Guide

**Problem**: User found workaround for commitment device
**Solutions**:
1. Increase enforcement strength (locked mode, third-party control)
2. Add secondary commitment device as backup
3. Add social layer (accountability partner monitors device)
4. Examine why they want the workaround (is goal misaligned?)

**Problem**: Commitment device feels punishing/resentful
**Solutions**:
1. Reduce stakes temporarily
2. Add positive incentives alongside negative ones
3. Reframe as self-care rather than restriction
4. Check goal alignment with values
5. Make device more flexible with planned exceptions

**Problem**: Device stopped working after initial period
**Solutions**:
1. Refresh the stakes (increase or change consequence)
2. Add variety to prevent habituation
3. Layer multiple devices for reinforcement
4. Check if behavior has become habitual (device may no longer be needed)
5. Progressive challenge (increase difficulty)

**Problem**: Too many commitment devices causing overwhelm
**Solutions**:
1. Reduce to 1-3 active devices maximum
2. Choose highest-leverage behaviors only
3. Consolidate multiple devices into single system
4. Phase implementation (one device per month)

## Advanced Strategies

### Graduated Commitment

**Concept**: Start with weak commitment devices, strengthen over time

**Phase 1 (Testing)**: Low-stakes, reversible commitment
- Public declaration on social media
- Small financial bet ($10-25)
- App deletion (can reinstall)
- **Duration**: 7-30 days

**Phase 2 (Establishing)**: Moderate stakes, harder to reverse
- Accountability partner with check-ins
- Moderate financial bet ($50-100)
- One-time environmental change
- **Duration**: 30-90 days

**Phase 3 (Solidifying)**: High stakes, difficult to reverse
- Public bet with significant amount
- Irreversible environmental change
- Professional accountability (paid coach)
- **Duration**: 90+ days

**Phase 4 (Maintaining)**: Habit is established, device is optional
- Reduce reliance on external commitment
- Keep minimal device as safety net
- Focus on intrinsic motivation
- **Duration**: Ongoing

### Stacked Commitment Devices

**Concept**: Layer multiple commitment types for maximum effectiveness

**Example Stack for Exercise**:
1. **Financial**: $500 bet via StickK (lose money if < 3 workouts/week)
2. **Social**: Accountability partner, daily check-in
3. **Physical**: Gym bag packed the night before
4. **Temporal**: Workout scheduled in calendar as non-negotiable
5. **Environmental**: Moved to apartment with gym

**Why It Works**:
- Multiple enforcement mechanisms
- If one fails, others catch you
- Different motivation types (appeals to different psychological drivers)
- Redundancy builds resilience

**How to Implement**:
1. Start with one device, ensure compliance
2. Add second device from different category
3. Monitor which devices are most effective
4. Keep 2-3 most effective, remove others
5. Adjust stack based on compliance data

### Asymmetric Commitment (Rewards + Penalties)

**Concept**: Combine positive and negative consequences

**Structure**:
- **Penalty**: What you lose for NOT doing behavior
- **Reward**: What you gain for doing behavior

**Example**:
- **Penalty**: $50 to anti-charity for each missed workout
- **Reward**: $20 to fun fund for each completed workout
- **Net effect**: Massive difference between doing and not doing

**Why It Works**:
- Loss aversion is powerful (penalty hurts more than reward feels good)
- Reward provides positive motivation
- Creates maximum spread between options

**Implementation**:
- Use Beeminder for penalty (automatic)
- Use separate app/jar for rewards (manual)
- Make penalty 2-3x larger than reward
- Both must be meaningful to you

### Pre-Commitment to Progressive Difficulty

**Concept**: Commit not just to behavior, but to increasing difficulty over time

**Example**:
- **Month 1**: 2 workouts/week
- **Month 2**: 3 workouts/week
- **Month 3**: 4 workouts/week
- **Commitment**: Set up Beeminder with escalating goals in advance

**Why It Works**:
- Prevents plateau and boredom
- Commitment made when motivated (harder to back out later)
- Creates progressive challenge (Goldilocks Rule)

**How to Implement**:
1. Map out progression for next 3-6 months
2. Set up commitment device with scheduled increases
3. Make increases automatic, not optional
4. Review and adjust only if injured/major life change

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Frozen Credit Card

**Background**: Maya had a credit card debt problem, shopping online impulsively when stressed.

**Commitment Device**:
- Froze credit card in large block of ice in freezer
- Deleted saved payment methods from all online retailers
- Set up auto-pay for minimum payment
- Told roommate about commitment, asked them to monitor freezer

**Results**:
- First week: Frustrated, wanted to thaw card, roommate talked her down
- First month: Urges to shop decreased, found alternative stress relief
- Three months: Debt decreasing steadily, had only thawed card once (emergency)
- Six months: Paid off debt, card still frozen "just in case"

**Key Success Factors**:
- Physical barrier created thinking time before purchase
- Social accountability prevented weakening of commitment
- Alternative stress management strategies developed
- Tangible progress reinforced commitment

### Case Study 2: The Naked Writer (Victor Hugo)

**Already detailed above in historical section**

### Case Study 3: The 6am Workout Class

**Background**: Tom wanted to exercise consistently but always skipped morning workouts when alarm went off.

**Commitment Device**:
- Signed up for 6am CrossFit class
- Paid for entire month upfront ($200)
- Added friend who would meet him there
- If he didn't show, had to Venmo friend $20
- Class was 15 minutes from home (had to leave by 5:40am)

**Results**:
- First week: Made 2/3 classes (paid friend $20 once)
- First month: Made 11/12 classes
- Three months: Consistent 3x/week, stopped needing friend accountability
- Six months: Workout had become favorite part of day

**Key Success Factors**:
- Financial investment (sunk cost)
- Social accountability (friend waiting)
- Additional penalty (Venmo payment for no-show)
- Class structure (scheduled time, can't postpone)
- Fixed location (removed "where should I workout?" decision)

### Case Study 4: The Social Media Delete

**Background**: Chen spent 3-4 hours daily on social media, felt unable to stop.

**Commitment Device**:
- Deleted all social media apps from phone
- Used Freedom to block sites on computer during work hours
- Gave girlfriend password to override Freedom blocks
- Announced 30-day break on all platforms before deleting
- Installed Rescue Time to track phone usage

**Results**:
- First 3 days: Phantom phone reaching, withdrawal symptoms
- First week: Extra 2-3 hours/day, felt disoriented
- Two weeks: Started reading again, felt more present
- 30 days: Only checked via browser 2-3x/week, 20 minutes total
- 90 days: Decided to keep apps deleted permanently

**Key Success Factors**:
- App deletion created high friction
- Browser-only access was enough barrier
- Time-tracking showed progress
- Public announcement created social accountability
- Girlfriend password control prevented late-night reactivation

### Case Study 5: The Automatic Saver

**Background**: Priya wanted to save more but always spent what was in checking account.

**Commitment Device**:
- Set up automatic transfer: $500 from checking to savings on payday
- Opened high-yield savings account with different bank (harder to access)
- No debit card for savings account
- Any transfer from savings back to checking required 3-day wait
- Set up auto-increase: $25 more every 3 months

**Results**:
- First month: Tight budget, but managed
- Six months: $3,000 saved, barely noticed the transfers
- One year: $6,500 saved, auto-increase kicked in twice
- Two years: $14,000 saved, emergency fund established

**Key Success Factors**:
- Automation removed decision-making
- Different bank created access barrier
- Transfer delay prevented impulse withdrawal
- Progressive increase prevented plateau
- Paid herself first (before spending on anything else)

## Summary

Commitment devices are among the most powerful tools for behavior change because they work with your psychology rather than against it. By making one good decision that constrains hundreds of future decisions, you eliminate the need for constant willpower and create environments where good behavior is automatic and bad behavior is difficult.

**Core Principles**:
1. **One decision now beats hundreds later**: Pre-commit to reduce decision fatigue
2. **Make it hard to fail**: Add meaningful consequences to create motivation
3. **Remove choice entirely when possible**: Best decision is not having to decide
4. **Match device to motivation type**: Financial for loss-averse, social for reputation-driven, etc.
5. **Start small, strengthen gradually**: Test before fully committing

**Key Success Factors**:
- Meaningful stakes (big enough to motivate, not so big you avoid committing)
- Enforcement mechanisms (prevent workarounds)
- Clear, measurable criteria (no ambiguity)
- Alignment with values (you actually want the change)
- Appropriate difficulty (challenging but achievable)

**Remember**: The goal is to design your life so good behaviors are automatic and bad behaviors are hard. One-time actions, automated systems, and environmental design are worth far more than daily willpower.

Start with ONE commitment device, master it, then expand your system strategically.
